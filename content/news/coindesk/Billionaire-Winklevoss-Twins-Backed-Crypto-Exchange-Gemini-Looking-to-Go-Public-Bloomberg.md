Crypto exchange Gemini, backed by billionaire Winklevoss twins, is weighing an initial public offering (IPO) listing, Bloomberg [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/winklevoss-twins-crypto-exchange-gemini-is-said-to-weigh-ipo?sref=3REHEaVI) citing people familiar.

Gemini is in talks with potential advisers for the listing, and it could come as soon as this year, Bloomberg reported, noting no final decisions have been made.   
The news of a potential IPO comes as sentiment in the crypto market has been buoyed by President Donald Trump's promise to create a more friendly environment for the digital assets sector.

Most recently, Bullish Global, the parent company of CoinDesk, was [reported](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/05/bullish-global-weighs-ipo-as-early-as-this-year-amid-crypto-market-optimism-bloomberg) to have hired Jefferies to evaluate a potential IPO this year. Other crypto firms, such as [Circle](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/30/circle-said-to-be-trading-around-5b-valuation-ahead-of-planned-ipo-sources) and [Kraken](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/06/06/kraken-said-to-be-raising-over-100m-pre-ipo-funding-bloomberg), have also been reported to be weighing public listings.

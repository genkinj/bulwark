The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Tesla [(TSLA)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tsla) CEO Elon Musk, has been using [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) software to analyze sensitive data from the U.S. Education Department. The data includes personally identifiable information and internal financial details, which are being used to investigate the department’s programs and spending. The AI investigation is focused on examining funds disbursed by the department and includes contracts, grants, and expenses.

The DOGE team has been accessing the Education Department’s financial data through Microsoft’s [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft) Azure cloud service. It is worth noting that it was Agency leadership that directed lower-level employees to grant Musk’s team access to the data. In fact, a spokesperson for the Education Department defended the actions by stating that the DOGE employees are working to make the department more cost-efficient and accountable.

The DOGE team’s ultimate goal is to reduce spending and shrink the Education Department. The team also plans to replicate this process of using AI to analyze spending on employees and programs across other government departments and agencies. This effort is part of a broader push to identify areas of potential fraud or waste in government spending.

China has added PVH Corp. (PVH), the parent company of both clothing brands, to its infamous “unreliable entities” list, allowing the government in Beijing to fine the retailers, prohibit import and export activities, revoke work permits, and deny employees entry to the country, among other powers.

The result is that PVH Corp. could be forced to shutdown its Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein stores, as well as its manufacturing facilities, within China. The move by Beijing comes amid [escalating trade tensions](https://www.tipranks.com/news/china-weighs-taking-bite-of-apples-nasdaqaapl-app-store-fees) between China and the U.S. after President [Donald Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) slapped 10% tariffs on most goods imported from the Asian nation.

**Targeting U.S. Companies**
----------------------------

PVH Corp. was added to the unreliable entities list in China along with a slew of other retaliatory measures made against the U.S., including new duties on energy imports and farm equipment. It is not clear if China’s actions [against PVH Corp.](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/pvh-corp-price-target-lowered-to-95-from-105-at-wells-fargo) extend to Hong Kong, where the U.S. company’s Asia-Pacific headquarters are based.

In a written statement, PVH Corp. said that it was “surprised and deeply disappointed” by China’s decision. China represented 6% of PVH’s sales and 16% of its earnings in 2023, but it relies more heavily on the country for manufacturing, which is the bigger risk to its global operations. PVH has more factories and suppliers in China than in any other region, representing about 18% of its total production.

PVH Corp. has operated in China for more than 20 years. Its [stock has declined 33%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/pvh) in the past year.

**Is PVH Stock a Buy?**
-----------------------

The stock of PVH Corp. has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 12 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on six Buy and six Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average PVH price target](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/pvh-corp-price-target-lowered-to-95-from-105-at-wells-fargo) of $118.91 implies nearly 50% upside from current levels.

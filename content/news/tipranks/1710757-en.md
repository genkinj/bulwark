MicroStrategy bought a record number of Bitcoins during the fourth quarter – 218,887 to be exact – worth $20.5 billion. As of December 31, the firm held 447,470 Bitcoins at an average cost of $62,503 per Bitcoin. This equates to a total value of $16.007 billion. In addition, the firm’s BTC yield came in at 74.3% for Fiscal Year 2024. BTC Yield measures the percent change in the ratio of Bitcoin holdings to total assumed diluted shares. This metric helps the company evaluate whether its Bitcoin buying strategy adds value to shareholders (the higher the yield, the better).

Furthermore, according to the company’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang, MicroStrategy will introduce a new key performance indicator – BTC $ Gain – and adopt fair value accounting for its bitcoin holdings in 2025. BTC $ Gain will be used to show the dollar value of the amount of Bitcoin gained.

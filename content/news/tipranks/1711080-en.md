The chipmaker announced earnings per share of $0.39, which beat the [consensus estimate](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arm/earnings) among analysts of $0.34. Revenue in the period came in at $983 million, which was above Wall Street forecasts that called for $949 million.

Arm also guided for sales of $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion in the current quarter, which surpassed the $1.22 billion estimate of analysts who track the company’s progress. Despite the strong results and guidance, ARM stock is down 6% in after hours trading. Analysts were quick to attribute the drop to profit taking after the company’s [share price gained](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arm) more than 130% in the last 12 months.

**AI-Driven Growth**
--------------------

Management of Arm Holdings attributed the [strong results](https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/arm-reports-q3-adjusted-eps-39c-consensus-34c) largely to [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) (AI) demand. “With our high-performance, energy efficient, flexible technology, Arm is a key enabler in advancing [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) innovation and transforming the user experience, from the edge to the cloud,” said CEO Rene Haas.

Arm Holdings makes money by licensing its microchip designs to [semiconductor](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/chips-stocks) companies and smartphone makers. Arm’s latest advanced microchip, the “Armv9,” generates significantly higher royalty rates than its predecessors. The company is also making inroads in high-end cloud server processors through customers such as Microsoft [(MSFT)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/msft).

**Is ARM Stock a Buy?**
-----------------------

The stock of Arm Holdings has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 19 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 15 Buy, three Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average ARM price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arm/forecast) of $162.20 implies 6.38% downside from current levels.

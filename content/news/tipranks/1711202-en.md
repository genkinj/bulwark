[Executives at Amazon](https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazon-amzn-faces-new-lawsuit-over-canadian-warehouse-closures) are now putting the final touches on the new Alexa device that will be powered by the company’s most advanced AI, according to media reports.

**Redesigned Alexa**
--------------------

A new Alexa has been in the works at Amazon for several years. The company first previewed a redesigned Alexa back in 2023, demonstrating a live conversation between a company executive and the voice assistant as part of a yet-to-be-released feature called “Let’s Chat.” Amazon did not hold its usual autumn event last year where it announces new products.

There are rumors that [Amazon](https://www.tipranks.com/news/amazons-amzn-jeff-bezos-10b-fund-ends-support-for-climate-group) plans to charge a monthly subscription fee for the new Alexa voice assistant to help cover the steep costs involved in making the technology. Although hundreds of millions of customers have Alexa-enabled devices in their homes, Amazon has struggled to monetize the product. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Amazon has lost tens of billions of dollars on its various devices.

[AMZN stock has increased 40%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn) in the last 12 months.

**Is AMZN Stock a Buy?**
------------------------

The stock of Amazon has a consensus Strong Buy rating among 40 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 39 Buy and one Hold recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average price target on AMZN](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/forecast)stock of $261.78 implies 10.84% upside from current levels.

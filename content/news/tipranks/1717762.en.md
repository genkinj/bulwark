Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel was blocked by the Biden administration, but there is some budding hope that [Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) could overturn the ruling despite previously voicing opposition to the deal.

The talks with Burritt on Thursday come as President Trump is due to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday, raising hopes that Nippon could yet close the deal.

“We are convinced that our acquisition plan is the best proposal for U.S. Steel,” Nippon Steel’s vice chairman, Takahiro Mori, was reported by *Reuters* as saying on Thursday.

“If Trump fully understands that, I believe he might reconsider his position.”

**Could Trump Change His Mind on U.S. Steel?**
----------------------------------------------

Previously, Trump has been against the deal, which became politicized during the election campaign. “I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,” he said last year.

However, it’s thought that he could be ready to accept the deal if it protects jobs.

The bid “contributes to Trump’s goals of promoting U.S. investment, creating U.S. jobs, and strengthening U.S. manufacturing through new investment and advanced technology transfer,” Nippon said in a statement.

X stock finished 3.56% higher in Thursday’s session to $39.27, though this is approximately 30% below the $55 per share offer from Nippon.

Following the Biden administration’s rejection of the Nippon deal Cleveland-Cliffs [(CLF)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/clf) joined up with Nucor [(NUE)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/nue) to bid for U.S. Steel, offering $40 a share.

**Is U.S Steel a Good Stock to Buy Now?**
-----------------------------------------

Overall, Wall Street has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on X stock, based on three Buys and three Holds. The [average X price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/x/forecast) of $39.80 implies over 1% upside from the current level, however it is contingent on the Nippon deal.

The Fed has released the parameters for its annual stress test showing smaller hypothetical shocks to the U.S. economy that banks must withstand. Since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, U.S. lenders have been required to pass particularly onerous stress tests and ensure they have adequate capital reserves to weather major financial crises.

But now, the U.S. central bank appears to be [easing up on the banks](https://www.tipranks.com/news/wells-fargo-wfc-moves-closer-to-having-asset-cap-lifted). The 2025 stress test includes calls for a U.S. jobless rate of 10% and a 33% drop in home prices. That’s much less dramatic than the stress test scenarios presented to banks in recent years.

**Good News for Banks**
-----------------------

In a statement , the Fed said it is taking steps to “reduce the volatility of stress test results and begin to improve model transparency” with the 2025 exam. [Shares of banks](https://www.tipranks.com/news/jpmorgan-jpm-to-deliver-4b-worth-of-gold-bullion-amid-tariff-fears) that include Citigroup [(C)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/c) and Morgan Stanley [(MS)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ms) rose as much as 3% on the positive news.

The stress tests were first introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with the biggest U.S. banks having to undergo annual exams that test their ability to withstand a severe recession while continuing to lend to consumers and businesses throughout the country.

This year’s changes to the stress test bolster the case made by many on Wall Street that U.S. banks will face a friendlier environment under President Donald Trump. By making the stress test less challenging, banks could now be required to hold smaller capital reserves, which is a positive for them.

**Is JPM Stock a Buy?**
-----------------------

The stock of JPMorgan Chase has a consensus Moderate Buy rating among 20 Wall Street analysts. That rating is based on 12 Buy, seven Hold, and one Sell recommendations issued in the last three months. The [average JPM price target](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/jpm/forecast) of $269.00 implies 1.66% downside risk from current levels.

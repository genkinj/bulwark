Swire Pacific ( [(HK:0019)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0019) ) has shared an update.

Swire Properties Limited anticipates a decrease in its financial performance for the year ending December 31, 2024, compared to 2023. The company expects its recurring underlying profit to drop to approximately HK$6.5 billion, primarily due to higher net finance charges and reduced rental income from Hong Kong offices. Additionally, the underlying profit is projected to fall to around HK$6.8 billion owing to the absence of a previous one-off profit from property disposal and decreased sales of car parking spaces. Despite these challenges, Swire’s Hong Kong office portfolio exceeded occupancy rates compared to the broader market.

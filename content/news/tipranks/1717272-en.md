**Trump’s Memecoin Ventures Raise Ethical Concerns**
----------------------------------------------------

Trump’s crypto activities are highly unusual for a world leader. His ties to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto firm rumored to have bought $2 million in MOVE tokens, raise ethical questions. Legal experts highlight concerns about political figures profiting from policies they directly influence. According to U.S. attorney Charlyn Ho, who spoke to *Cointelegraph’s Magazine*, this “creates a serious conflict of interest,” as Trump can shape crypto regulations to his advantage.

**Could Trump’s Ventures Breach Laws?**
---------------------------------------

While Trump’s family denies direct involvement with WLFI, Ho warns that attempts to skirt regulations through such affiliations could still face legal challenges. Yuriy Brisov, a European legal expert, noted that EU countries have stringent anti-money laundering rules, which memecoins might bypass.

Trump’s actions reveal how uncharted the intersection of politics and crypto remains. With existing laws struggling to keep pace, the global debate over regulating political figures’ crypto ventures is just beginning.

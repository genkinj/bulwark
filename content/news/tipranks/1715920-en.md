The Seattle-based company announced earnings per share (EPS) of $1.86, which was well ahead of the $1.49 [consensus expectation](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn/earnings) of analysts. The profit nearly double from $1 per share a year ago. Revenue of $187.79 billion was also ahead of the $187.30 billion that was forecast on Wall Street. Sales were up 10% from a year earlier.

Among the company’s closely watched business units, Amazon Web Services (AWS) that focuses on cloud computing posted revenue of $28.8 billion, which matched analysts’ estimates. Cloud computing revenue grew 19% during the quarter compared to 13% a year earlier. Advertising sales of $17.3 billion were slightly below forecasts that called for $17.4 billion.

**Weak Outlook**
----------------

Despite the decent Q4 numbers, Amazon offered a weak outlook for the current first quarter of 2025, saying that it expects sales between $151 billion and $155.5 billion. Wall Street had been looking for Q1 2025 revenue of $158.5 billion. The soft guidance was blamed on an “an unusually large, unfavorable impact” from foreign exchange rates.

The U.S. dollar has risen against other currencies since the American election last November causing issues for companies such as Amazon that have extensive international operations. Based on Amazon’s forecast, the company only expects revenue growth of 5% to 9% in the current quarter. At the low end of the range, that would mark the slowest growth on record for Amazon since it went public in 1997.

Amazon’s capital expenditures in the final quarter of last year totaled $27.8 billion, up from $14.6 billion a year ago. The company has been plowing billions into data centers and equipment to run its [artificial intelligence](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) (AI) products. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company’s [AI](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/artificial-intelligence) investments in the earnings news release, including a new set of AI models called “Nova” and its Trainium microchips.

[AMZN stock has gained 40%](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/amzn) in the past 12 months.

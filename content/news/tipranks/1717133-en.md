The SEC has sent ripples through the [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) world by acknowledging ETF applications for Solana (**[SOL-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd)**), Litecoin (**[LTC-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/ltc-usd)**), and XRP (**[XRP-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/xrp-usd)**).

**SEC Acknowledges Multiple ETF Filings**
-----------------------------------------

On Thursday, the SEC recognized [Grayscale’s application for a Solana ETF and a separate Litecoin ETF filing](https://www.tipranks.com/news/btc-and-ltc-surge-after-fed-rate-pause-litecoins-etf-filing-progresses). In addition, BlackRock [(BLK)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/blk) made a move to enhance its iShares [Bitcoin](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/btc-usd) ETF [(IBIT)](https://www.tipranks.com/etf/ibit) by proposing in-kind creations and redemptions. This isn’t just routine paperwork—Eric Balchunas, *Bloomberg’s* senior ETF analyst, called it a “baby step into new territory,” one that might reflect a leadership shift within the regulator.

The SEC also received filings from Cboe to list four XRP-focused [ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/etf) from companies like Bitwise and WisdomTree. These filings, known as 19b-4 documents, indicate that the ETF providers are ready to push ahead.

****Regulatory Sentiment Shifts Toward Crypto Approval****
----------------------------------------------------------

For years, ETF applications linked to assets like XRP and Solana faced hurdles as the SEC categorized them as securities. But now, companies seem more optimistic. According to Balchunas, the current SEC administration appears friendlier toward expanding beyond Bitcoin and [Ethereum](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/eth-usd) ETFs.

**What Is the Best Bitcoin ETF to Buy?**
----------------------------------------

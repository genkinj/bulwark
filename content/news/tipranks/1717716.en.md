Gemini, the [crypto](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency) exchange founded by billionaire twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, is reportedly gearing up for a potential initial public offering (IPO) as early as this year.

This isn’t Gemini’s first flirtation with going public. Back in 2021, the Winklevoss brothers hinted at the possibility but ultimately shelved the plan. Now, with President [Donald Trump](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/djt) pledging a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, momentum is picking up.

**Other Crypto Giants Plan IPOs**
---------------------------------

The IPO move comes as optimism returns to the digital assets sector. Other major players, such as Bullish Global and Circle, are also weighing public listings.

Gemini, despite facing challenges like the bankruptcy of its lending partner Genesis and a $37 million fine for compliance issues, has demonstrated resilience. The company managed to return over $1.1 billion to its Earn Program customers.

Bitwise Asset Management expects at least five crypto unicorns to go public in 2025, with Gemini poised to lead the charge in this growing trend.

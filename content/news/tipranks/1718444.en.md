An update from Beijing Capital International Airport Co ( [(HK:0694)](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/hk:0694) ) is now available.

Beijing Capital International Airport Company Limited anticipates a significant reduction in its loss before income tax for the year ending December 31, 2024, compared to the previous year, due to a recovery in aviation demand. However, despite the narrowed pre-tax loss, the reversal of deferred tax assets will lead to a higher overall loss due to increased income tax expenses, although this will not directly impact the company’s cash flow or daily operations.

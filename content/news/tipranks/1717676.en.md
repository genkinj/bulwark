**ETF Competition Intensifies**
-------------------------------

This move adds to the surge in crypto ETF applications since President Donald Trump’s administration took over in January. The timing is key. SEC leadership changes, including the [resignation of former Chair Gary Gensler](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/01/20/it-s-official-gary-gensler-is-out-at-the-sec-and-crypto-friendly-mark-uyeda-is-in), have created an opening for more pro-crypto initiatives. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda has brought in policy experts from crypto-friendly groups like Coin Center, signaling a shift in regulatory tone.

Bitwise made a similar filing just weeks earlier with its own Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, and Cboe BZX Exchange also submitted proposals for spot XRP [ETFs](https://www.tipranks.com/etf) on behalf of four asset managers.

While the Franklin ETF will only include Bitcoin and Ether for now, the firm acknowledged potential risks from other rising cryptocurrencies like Solana (**[SOL-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/sol-usd)**) and Cardano (**[ADA-USD](https://www.tipranks.com/cryptocurrency/ada-usd)**). For now, investors are watching closely to see whether this influx of crypto ETF filings will get the regulatory green light.

**What Is the Best Bitcoin ETF to Buy?**

As the third season of the SA20 league approaches its highly anticipated final on February 8, 2025, MI Cape Town will face Sunrisers Eastern Cape for the title. During a virtual media interaction, SA20 Ambassador Allan Donald shared his thoughts on the tournament’s growth, the platform it provides for South African cricketers, and the exciting final matchup.
 
**The Growth and Future of SA20** 
Reflecting on the tournament’s success this season, Donald praised the quality of the league and its rapid development. "It’s hard to believe a month has already passed. Everything about this league has been magnificently organized. It feels like a T20 World Cup, and Graeme and his team have done a phenomenal job. SA20 has found the right T20 model, and this league has immense potential. The overseas players have been impactful, especially in mentoring our young players. Seeing a player like Kane Williamson guiding Matthew Breetzke is simply amazing. As a South African, this is a big deal, and I can confidently say this league will continue to grow over the next 10-20 years. For a third-season tournament, I’m absolutely blown away by what I’ve experienced."  **ALSO READ: [Champions Trophy 2025: England won't boycott Afghanistan match - ECB chair](https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/champions-trophy-2025-england-won-t-boycott-afghanistan-match-ecb-chair-125020701532_1.html)** 
 
**A Platform for Young South African Talent** 
Donald highlighted how SA20 serves as a vital platform for the next generation of South African cricketers. "That’s why we bring in overseas players—to work with our young fast bowlers and batters. Watching Richard Gleeson perform for Eastern Cape and Ottniel Baartman bowl alongside him is fantastic. Players like Marco Jansen are learning the art of bowling at the death from seasoned professionals. SA20 offers a steep learning curve—what a young player can pick up in a month here is equivalent to six months of regular cricket due to the high-pressure environment. It’s a fast-paced learning opportunity that mirrors what I’ve seen in the IPL."
 
**Emerging Stars of the Season** 
Donald also highlighted standout young players, particularly Rubin Hermann, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, and Ethan Bosch. "Rubin has impressed for Paarl Royals, and his brother, Jordan, has flourished after getting his opportunity. Kwena Maphaka has been outstanding as well. One player who has been an unsung hero is Bjorn Fortuin, a left-arm spinner who’s been vital for Paarl Royals, especially in the powerplay. Ethan Bosch has announced himself on the Test stage, and I’m thrilled for him. His father, Tertius, a former fast bowler, would be proud of his son’s achievements."  **ALSO READ: [Pakistan opener Saim Ayub ruled out of Champions Trophy 2025: PCB](https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/pakistan-opener-saim-ayub-ruled-out-of-champions-trophy-2025-pcb-125020700986_1.html)**
 
**Allan Donald's verdict on the MI Cape Town vs. Sunrisers Eastern Cape Final** 
Looking forward to the final, Donald expressed excitement about the showdown between MI Cape Town and Sunrisers Eastern Cape. "MI Cape Town are the favorites, based on their form, but the boys from Eastern Cape have peaked at the right time. It’s going to be an incredible match, possibly with scores nearing 220 or 230. MI Cape Town has been clinical, deserving to be in the final, but Sunrisers Eastern Cape has shown remarkable character."  [**Check all latest updates on Champions Trophy 2025 here**](https://www.business-standard.com/cricket/champions-trophy/pakistan-opener-saim-ayub-ruled-out-of-champions-trophy-2025-pcb-125020700986_1.html)
 
**Challenges for Sunrisers Eastern Cape** 
When asked about the challenges Sunrisers might face, Donald acknowledged their resilience. "They’ve played in two finals before and have dealt with challenges. Their coach, Adrian Birrell, is a great strategist who knows how to keep players calm. Although they had a rough start with three consecutive losses, they bounced back, won five straight matches, and delivered two dominant performances. The only factor that could influence the game is the pitch, but both teams will face the same conditions. MI Cape Town has pressure on them after two tough seasons. They will need to be at their best to win. Meanwhile, Sunrisers have found their spark and will come out swinging."
 
As the final draws near, both teams will be prepared to battle it out, but Donald believes it will be MI Cape Town’s need to play at their absolute best that will decide the winner.

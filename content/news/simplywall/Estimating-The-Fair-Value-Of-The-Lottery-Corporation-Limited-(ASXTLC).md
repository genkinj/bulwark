### Key Insights

* The projected fair value for Lottery is AU$4.42 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
* Current share price of AU$4.93 suggests Lottery is potentially trading close to its fair value
* [The AU$5.38 analyst price target for TLC](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/consumer-services/asx-tlc/lottery-shares/valuation) is 22% more than our estimate of fair value

Does the February share price for The Lottery Corporation Limited ([ASX:TLC](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/consumer-services/asx-tlc/lottery-shares)) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!

We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the [Simply Wall St analysis model](https://github.com/SimplyWallSt/Company-Analysis-Model/blob/master/MODEL.markdown#discounted-cash-flow-dcf).

The Method
----------

We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

#### 10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast

|  | **2025** | **2026** | **2027** | **2028** | **2029** | **2030** | **2031** | **2032** | **2033** | **2034** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Levered FCF (A$, Millions)** | AU$469.7m | AU$498.5m | AU$531.8m | AU$541.0m | AU$570.0m | AU$591.1m | AU$610.9m | AU$630.0m | AU$648.7m | AU$667.2m |
| **Growth Rate Estimate Source** | Analyst x6 | Analyst x6 | Analyst x6 | Analyst x1 | Analyst x1 | Est @ 3.70% | Est @ 3.36% | Est @ 3.13% | Est @ 2.96% | Est @ 2.85% |
| **Present Value (A$, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9%** | AU$435 | AU$428 | AU$424 | AU$399 | AU$390 | AU$375 | AU$359 | AU$343 | AU$328 | AU$312 |

*("Est" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)*  
**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = AU$3.8b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.6%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.9%.

**Terminal Value (TV)**= FCF2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$667m× (1 + 2.6%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.6%) = AU$13b

**Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)**= TV / (1 + r)10= AU$13b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= AU$6.0b

The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is AU$9.8b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$4.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

ASX:TLC Discounted Cash Flow February 6th 2025

The Assumptions
---------------

The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Lottery as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.287. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Moving On:
----------

Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Lottery, we've compiled three further aspects you should assess:

1. **Risks**: For example, we've discovered [**2 warning signs for Lottery**](https://simplywall.st/stocks/au/consumer-services/asx-tlc/lottery-shares) that you should be aware of before investing here.

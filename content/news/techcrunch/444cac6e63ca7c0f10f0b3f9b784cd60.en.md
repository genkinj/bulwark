According to [a New York Times report](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/06/us/president-trump-news?smid=url-share#e37fe86e-ada6-500a-b2ed-b5803b6d64b1), on Thursday, the U.S. government’s General Services Administration (GSA) removed the spoon emoji as an option that users of its videoconferencing platform can select to express themselves. The move comes a day after workers [embraced the digital cutlery](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/federal-employees-musk-protest-spoon.html) to protest the Trump administration’s [“Fork in the Road”](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286477/fork-in-the-road-twitter-federal-workers) resignation offer.

The emailed offer, titled “A Fork in the Road” — it’s exactly how Elon Musk titled an email to Twitter employees soon after he purchased the platform — is a bid for government workers to resign their roles while receiving payment through September.

The proposal has raised the ire of federal workers and [labor unions](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/federal-worker-union-sues-trump-over-fork-in-the-road-offer) alike. On Wednesday, employees at the Technology Transformation Services division of the GSA reportedly unleashed a torrent of spoon emojis in the chat that accompanied an organization-wide, 600-person video conference with new leader Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer. Some have also taken to adding a spoon to their Slack status as a form of silent protest.

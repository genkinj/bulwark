Welcome back to **TechCrunch Mobility** — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free — just click [TechCrunch Mobility](https://techcrunch.com/newsletters/)!

We knew this day was coming: **Cruise** is dead — at least as a robotaxi company. **General Motors** completed its acquisition of GM Cruise Holdings LLC; Cruise is now a wholly owned subsidiary of GM.

The upshot is a [50% reduction in staff](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/cruise-to-slash-workforce-by-50-after-gm-cuts-funding-to-robotaxi-operations/) — that’s about 1,000 people. The next step is to integrate the remaining employees into the folds of GM, where they’ll work on improving the automaker’s advanced driver-assistance system.

Among my many questions about this is whether GM will successfully retain the remaining talent, most of whom I have been told are engineers. And will that fresh talent translate into an improved advanced driver-assistance system, branded as Super Cruise, and eventually personal autonomous vehicles?

I’m not convinced that acquiring talent — who were inspired by and loyal to Cruise’s now departed co-founder and CEO Kyle Vogt — is a good match. But hey, I’ve been wrong before.

Over the years, I’ve spoken to lots of Cruise engineers, and every time I would walk away thinking, “Well, there’s a true believer.” I haven’t met every Cruise employee, but the ones I have exuded a belief in the autonomous vehicle mission and seemed thrilled to be working long hours to achieve it.

For any current and former Cruisers out there, reach out. I would love to talk about the early days with you. Email me at [kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com](mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com/).

A little bird

A few more little birds came to us from **Cruise** in recent days. Much of the communication centered on the impending layoffs, which I addressed above. But I thought this was an interesting nugget from sources who shared how they thought — at least for a time — Cruise might restart its robotaxi operations.

One indicator was this tidbit from sources who told us that Cruise had been ready to implement a retrofitted sensor solution, internally referred to as Project Rhino, that would have solved for the October 2 incident by creating additional visibility and awareness underneath the car.  The “incident” is in reference to an event in 2023 when a pedestrian, who had initially been hit by a human-driven car, got stuck under and then dragged by one of the company’s robotaxis.

Terms were not disclosed. Applied Intuition is perhaps best known as an [autonomous vehicle software](https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/25/applied-intuition-300-million-secondary-fidelity/) company; lately it has been pushing deeper into defense.

**GenLogs**, a startup that developed freight intelligence software, [raised $14.6 million](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/genlogs-raises-14-6m-launches-intermodal-insights-sets-eyes-on-mexico) in a Series A funding round led by Venrock and HOF Capital.

### ADAS

We covered **Tesla** earnings in last week’s edition but wanted to [flag this article by Sean O’Kane](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/elon-musk-reveals-elon-musk-was-wrong-about-full-self-driving/), which reminds us of all the promises Elon Musk has made around his Full Self-Driving software and his recent admission that some of its vehicles will, in fact, need a hardware upgrade.

### Autonomous vehicles

The **California Department of Motor Vehicles** released data that shows a [50% drop in autonomous vehicle test miles](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/31/autonomous-vehicle-testing-in-california-dropped-50-heres-why/). Yes, the end of Cruise is partially responsible. But there are other factors at play. Here’s what else is going on.

**Waabi** has partnered with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to jointly develop and [deploy autonomous trucks](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/waabi-and-volvo-team-up-to-build-self-driving-trucks-at-scale/). Reminder: Volvo also has a deal with Aurora.

**Waymo** is now [showing up on the Uber app](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/waymo-just-popped-up-on-the-uber-app-in-austin-ahead-of-robotaxi-launch/) in Austin. For now, this doesn’t translate into a Waymo picking people up. But it will soon.

### Electric vehicles, charging, & batteries

The **Chicago Auto Show** is under way, and while most — like the **Subaru Forester Hybrid** — are mild hybrids or internal combustion engine-powered vehicles, there were EVs, too. **Stellantis** revealed the all-electric [2025 Jeep Wagoneer S Limited trim](https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/view-spec.do?id=26579) that starts at $66,995 and has an estimated range of 294 miles.

**Ford** reported earnings this week and, welp, its EV business lost about $5 billion in 2024. But that wasn’t the only thing that caught my eye. Instead, it was [CEO Jim Farley’s comments on tariffs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/ford-goes-protectionist-as-ev-losses-top-5b/).

**Scout Motors**, the Volkswagen spinout that plans to produce all-electric and range-extended electric trucks and SUVs, was [sued by a group of VW and Audi dealers](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/scout-motors-sued-over-plan-to-sell-evs-direct-to-consumers/) in Florida over its plan to sell directly to consumers.

### Ride-hailing and gig economy

**Lyft** has partnered with AI startup **Anthropic** to [build an AI assistant](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/lyfts-new-ai-customer-assistant-is-powered-by-anthropics-claude/) that handles initial intake for customer service inquiries for both riders and drivers.

### Space and future of flight

This is [an interesting feature](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/e-fuels-startup-will-make-diamonds-before-powering-jet-planes/) on a startup called **Circularity Fuels**, which will make diamonds on its path to creating e-fuels to power jet planes.

This week’s wheels

2025 Kia Niro EV.**Image Credits:**Kia

This week, we’ll hear from TechCrunch reporter Rebecca Bellan and her time driving a **2024 Kia Niro**. (Please note that the photo above is of a 2025 model.)

I rented a 2024 Kia Niro over the weekend to drive a couple hours north of New York City.

It’s a cute, zippy SUV, but I struggled in two areas needed for a road trip: battery life in winter and the location of the volume button/knob.

It only took about an hour and a half of driving, or about 70 miles, for the battery to go from fully charged to half empty.

This kicked my anxiety into gear, as I wasn’t sure where in the sticks of Connecticut I’d be able to find a charger. I found one, in the end, a lone EVgo charger in a Planet Fitness parking lot. “Marsha” was advertised to charge at 50 kW but ended up drip feeding my battery at a shocking pace of 17 kW. Let’s just say, I sat in that parking lot for a while.

The volume button or knob was also conspicuously absent. This is my biggest pet peeve with software-defined vehicles: the obsession with touch screens instead of tactile knobs that you can manipulate while you’re driving so you don’t have to take your eyes off the road. Neither I, nor any one of my passengers, were able to figure out how to adjust the volume without using the button on the wheel.

I finally just googled “Kia Niro volume” and sure enough I found a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KiaNiro/comments/ydhhjo/volume_control/) that I could have written myself. Apparently, one must tap the “button” above the orange fan to change out of climate control mode, and then one can use the left temperature knob to change the volume. Unbelievable.

*What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.*

[Safe Superintelligence](https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/19/ilya-sutskever-openais-former-chief-scientist-launches-new-ai-company/), the AI startup founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, is in talks to raise funding at a valuation of “at least” $20 billion, [according to Reuters](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-co-founder-sutskevers-153255776.html).

It’s not clear how much Safe Superintelligence — which has yet to generate any revenue — is looking to secure, but it could be substantial. The new figure is [4x the $5 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/ilya-sutskevers-startup-safe-super-intelligence-raises-1b/) the company held last September.

Little is known about Safe Superintelligence’s work. The company, which also counts ex-OpenAI researcher Daniel Levy and former Apple AI projects lead Daniel Gross among its founding team, has raised $1 billion so far. Existing investors include Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and DST Global.

Sutskever is widely respected in the AI — and wider tech — industry. He’s credited with contributing to major AI breakthroughs while at OpenAI, including the technical approach that made ChatGPT’s development possible.

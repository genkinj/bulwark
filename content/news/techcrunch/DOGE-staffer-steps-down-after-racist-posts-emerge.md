A 25-year-old engineer working for the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE) has stepped down over racist posts from an X account tied to him, the Wall Street Journal [reports.](https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93)

Marko Elez resigned after the WSJ asked the White House about his connection to the [account](https://x.com/marko_elez), which was in his name but has since deleted all its posts. The account posted “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity” and “Normalize Indian hate” in September 2024. It also advocated a “eugenic immigration policy” in the weeks leading up to President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025.

Elez had access to confidential federal payment records at the Treasury Department, WIRED [reported](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/) on Tuesday. He previously worked at X and SpaceX – both companies owned by Elon Musk, DOGE’s creator.

DOGE has sent young engineers like Elez across the federal government to implement mass restructuring plans, [raising security concerns](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/the-biggest-breach-of-u-s-government-data-is-under-way/) about their access to sensitive data.

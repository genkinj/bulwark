OpenAI co-founder John Schulman, who left AI company Anthropic earlier this week after a mere [five months](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/openai-co-founder-john-schulman-leaves-anthropic-after-just-five-months/), is reportedly joining [former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s secretive new startup](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/openai-co-founder-john-schulman-leaves-anthropic-after-just-five-months/), per Fortune.

It’s not clear what Schulman’s role there will be. Fortune wasn’t able to learn that information, and Murati has been tight-lipped about the venture since she left OpenAI in September. But one source did reveal to Fortune that Murati has recruited additional ex-OpenAI staff, including Christian Gibson, who had been serving on OpenAI’s supercomputing team.

Murati was reportedly in talks to raise over $100 million for her company in October.

Credited as one of the leading architects of ChatGPT, Schulman left OpenAI last August for Anthropic. He [posted](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/openai-co-founder-leaves-for-anthropic/) about the decision on X, saying it stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment — the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended — and engage in more hands-on technical work.

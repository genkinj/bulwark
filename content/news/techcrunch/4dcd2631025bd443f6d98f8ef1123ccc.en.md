[Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/), a U.S. firm providing a customer experience management platform to global brands, has laid off about 15% of its workforce — around 500 employees — due to business performance not meeting expectations, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.

The new layoffs come less than a year after the company [cut about 3% of its workforce](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/sprinklr-lays-off-more-than-100-employees/) in May and after it earlier [reduced its headcount by 4%](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/15/sprinklr-layoffs-2023/) in 2023. The two earlier layoffs impacted roughly 200 employees altogether.

The New York-headquartered company, which counts Microsoft, P&G, and Samsung among over 1,800 global customers, started notifying affected employees about the cuts this week, TechCrunch learned and confirmed with the company.

“We will refocus and rebalance our investments, talent, and resources in order to better serve our customers and partners and help them realize the full value of our AI-powered platform,” a Sprinklr spokesperson said in a statement.

The spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the move does not impact C-level positions.

The company will “continue to hire in prioritized areas” to focus on its “strategic priorities,” the spokesperson said.

Last week, Sprinklr [appointed](https://www.sprinklr.com/newsroom/sprinklr-announces-appointments-to-board-of-directors/) former PwC partner Jan Hauser and former Lenovo CEO and C3.ai founding member Stephen Ward as new board directors amid its shifting focus toward developing AI-led experiences. In a related announcement, Sprinklr said that current board member and audit committee chair, Ed Gillis, who has served since November 2015, is stepping down from his position at the end of March.

Per its most recent [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001569345/000156934524000019/cxm-20240131.htm) released in March of last year, Sprinklr had 3,869 employees, including 2,276 in India and 787 in the U.S.

“We will support departing teammates with the greatest care and respect, acknowledging their contributions to Sprinklr, and assisting them in their transition,” the spokesperson said.

Alongside Sprinklr, [Workday](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/workday-cuts-nearly-2000-employees/), [Okta](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/okta-lays-off-180-employees-nearly-one-year-after-last-workforce-reduction/), [Sonos](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/sonos-lays-off-200-ahead-of-rumored-set-top-box-release/), and [Cruise](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/cruise-to-slash-workforce-by-50-after-gm-cuts-funding-to-robotaxi-operations/) are among other companies announcing job cuts in recent days as businesses face challenges amid dynamic shifts.

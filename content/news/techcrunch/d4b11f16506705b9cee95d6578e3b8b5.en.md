Humanoid robotics company Figure raised eyebrows this week when it [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/04/figure-drops-openai-in-favor-of-in-house-models/) it would be stepping away from a partnership with OpenAI in favor of building its own in-house AI models. Figure CEO Brett Adcock alluded to a “major breakthrough” in their own process and plans to unveil “something no one has ever seen on a humanoid” in the coming month.

Figure isn’t the only company experimenting with non-OpenAI solutions either. Just last week, researchers from Stanford and the University of Washington [demonstrated](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/researchers-created-an-open-rival-to-openais-o1-reasoning-model-for-under-50/) that it’s possible to train a highly capable “reasoning” model for under $50 in cloud compute credits, a stark contrast to the costs often associated with OpenAI’s models.

TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec, Margaux MacColl, and Max Zeff are diving into the biggest news on today’s episode of [Equity](https://techcrunch.com/podcasts/equity/), including how the tide could be changing for OpenAI.

Listen to the full episode to hear about:

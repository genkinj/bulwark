Government officials in the United Kingdom have reportedly secretly ordered Apple to build a backdoor that would give its authorities access to users’ encrypted iCloud data.

[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/) reports that the demand was issued in January under the [U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act 2016](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/27/could-the-uk-be-about-to-break-end-to-end-encryption/), also known as the Snoopers’ Charter. Officials demanded “blanket” access to end-to-end encrypted files uploaded to its cloud by any user worldwide, according to the report, rather than asking for narrow access to specific Apple accounts.

According to the Post, Apple will likely stop offering its encrypted cloud storage offering, [Advanced Data Protection](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/07/apple-launches-end-to-end-encryption-for-icloud-data/), to users in the United Kingdom. That access would not give the U.K. authorities backdoor access to encrypted files in other countries, including the United States.

Apple did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s questions but has [previously warned](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/11/apples-encryption-fight-turns-to-the-uk/) that creating a so-called backdoor for law enforcement would expose users’ personal data to hackers.

TechCrunch contacted the U.K.’s Home Office for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication.

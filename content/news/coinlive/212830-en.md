Third-Party Wallets to Integrate TON Connect or Risk Suspension
===============================================================

[Telegram‚Äôs recent partnership with The Open Network (TON) Foundation](https://www.coinlive.com/news/telegram-goes-all-in-on-ton-for-crypto-apps-and-games ) is set to reshape how cryptocurrency wallets operate within the messaging app.

Under this exclusive deal, all third-party crypto wallets on Telegram must now integrate via TON Connect, making TON the sole supported blockchain for the platform's services, a TON Foundation spokesperson.

While Telegram presents this as a strategic alignment, critics view it as a move to tighten control over its blockchain ecosystem.

The agreement mandates that all Telegram Mini Apps with crypto features transition to the TON network by 21 February.

> [#Telegram](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Telegram?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) announced that third-party crypto wallets must adopt [#TON](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TON?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) Connect as the sole wallet connection protocol and require all Mini Apps to migrate to the TON blockchain by February 21, or face service suspension.

This includes bridging existing assets, migrating smart contracts, and adopting TON Connect exclusively.

However, Wallet in [Telegram](https://www.coinlive.com/news/ton-rallies-as-telegram-rolls-out-third-party-verification-search-filters ), the default third-party crypto wallet on the platform, will remain unaffected by these new requirements.

A spokesperson for the TON foundation said:

> ‚ÄúThe Wallet in Telegram is unaffected because it‚Äôs TON-based and only supports TON Connect for decentralized application interactions. After the migration period ends, third-party wallets that haven‚Äôt adopted TON Connect won‚Äôt be supported.‚Äù

TON Connect
===========

Introduced in April 2022, TON Connect is an open-source toolkit designed as a universal authorisation standard, facilitating seamless communication between wallets and applications within the TON ecosystem.

This protocol allows users to access apps and services using their TON wallets, eliminating the need for traditional logins and passwords.

With [Telegram‚Äôs updated terms of service](https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines ), the platform will now exclusively support crypto wallet integrations connected through TON Connect, reinforcing its commitment to the TON blockchain.

The terms of service noted:

> ‚ÄúTokens and NFTs [non-fungible tokens] on other blockchains like Ethereum and BNB are not permitted.‚Äù

> Telegram now forces all wallets to use TON Connect & Mini Apps to migrate to TON by Feb 21 or face suspension. Some devs worry about decentralization. IMO, this isn‚Äôt right and other chains like Solana should be supported too!

Community Outrage Over Telegram‚Äôs Decision
==========================================

[Telegram‚Äôs decision to exclusively tether its Mini App ecosystem to TON](https://www.coinlive.com/news/telegram-goes-all-in-on-ton-for-crypto-apps-and-games ) has sparked significant backlash, raising doubts about the platform's commitment to decentralisation and TON‚Äôs ability to handle increased network activity.

> Fucking TON, what a joke. Now Telegram's forcing third-party wallets to use their shit protocol, and they're basically creating a walled garden for crypto mini-apps. "Oh, don't worry, folks, your wallets are fine... as long as you use TON Connect." Meanwhile, the devs are all‚Ä¶

Some developers, including Grindery Wallet, are reconsidering their place within the Telegram ecosystem in response to the new restrictions.

Tim Delhaes, co-founder and CEO of the multi-chain wallet Grindery, warned that this exclusivity deal risks alienating developers and could render TON obsolete.

Delhaes highlighted the policy‚Äôs aggressive seven- to 10-day migration window for developers‚Äîa timeline far shorter than the months typically afforded in decentralised ecosystems for such transitions.

While Telegram has long positioned itself as a decentralisation advocate, Delhaes likened this move to the walled garden strategies of tech giants like Apple, [Google](https://www.coinlive.com/news/google-ceo-forecasts-75-billion-in-spending-for-2025-with ), and Meta, notorious for limiting external competition.

He stated:

> ‚ÄúTelegram is following in the footsteps of Big Tech by creating monopolies. The fact that they gave their partners ‚Äî the developers building on Telegram ‚Äî only a few days to adjust makes it rather challenging. This could significantly erode trust in Telegram and what it once stood for.‚Äù

Despite Grindery‚Äôs primary token being on TON, the wallet maintains compliance while reaffirming its commitment to building a multichain future beyond Telegram.

> I have been using Telegram since 2015 and with [@grindery\_io](https://twitter.com/grindery_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) building on Telegram since 2023. I respect every business‚Äôs right to choose its path‚Äîand I do the same. While Telegram has chosen to exclusively support TON, I have and still believe both Telegram & TON would benefit‚Ä¶

‚Äô

He expressed:

> ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre working in a somewhat centralized environment, like web2 tech world, you would likely expect companies to do that. But if you‚Äôre entering the web3 space with an aspiration of building open source systems and getting rid of walled gardens, you need to ask yourself, who really lives up to what they are publicly saying.‚Äù

Delhaes emphasized that these abrupt changes could ripple across the broader crypto landscape, creating uncertainty for developers working across diverse blockchain ecosystems.

He also questioned Telegram‚Äôs credibility in the blockchain space, pointing out that while projects like [Hamster Kombat](https://www.coinlive.com/news/hamster-kombat-reveals-significant-overhaul-in-season-2-lets-players ) and Notcoin have gained traction, much of the community and liquidity remain rooted in other networks.

Ultimately, Delhaes warned that Telegram‚Äôs exclusivity clause could reduce TON to a niche platform used primarily for gimmicks, despite its robust technical framework.

He added:

> ‚ÄúTelegram wants TON to be the payment rails of a super app, but I think this path [of irrelevance] is where they are going.‚Äù

> Telegram's new mandate requiring all third-party crypto wallets to integrate with TON Connect is raising significant concerns about decentralization in the blockchain space. This move could limit user autonomy and influence the future of decentralized finance. üåêüí¨

TON Foundation Steps Up to Defend its Decision
==============================================

The TON Foundation maintains that its new exclusivity policy will ultimately benefit both developers and users. https://www.coinlive.com/news/telegram-goes-all-in-on-ton-for-crypto-apps-and-games

In a statement, the spokesperson pointed out:

> ‚ÄúBy integrating TON as the exclusive blockchain for Telegram‚Äôs Mini App ecosystem, Telegram can now provide a robust, reliable, and scalable solution.‚Äù

When questioned about the potential for a developer exodus, the Foundation argued that consolidating the ecosystem under TON Connect will create a more unified and streamlined onboarding experience for crypto users and builders alike.

It emphasized that keeping developers engaged remains a core priority, recognising their critical role in driving ecosystem growth.

According to the Foundation, the updated terms of service simplify wallet integration, which could lead to higher user conversion rates.

Moreover, the [TON](https://www.coinlive.com/news/ton-rallies-as-telegram-rolls-out-third-party-verification-search-filters ) Foundation framed these changes as aligning with its broader vision of fostering a seamless, scalable, and user-friendly environment for both developers and end-users.

The spokesperson said:

> ‚ÄúAt the same time, we‚Äôre focused on balancing expansion with security and reliability, leveraging TON‚Äôs inherent scalability to support global user growth while continuously iterating on and improving the infrastructure.‚Äù

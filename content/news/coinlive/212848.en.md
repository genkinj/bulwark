Ethereum developers have confirmed key testing dates for the long-awaited Pectra upgrade, which will bring the blockchain closer to its first major update in nearly a year. Developers expect the upgrade to go live on the mainnet in early April if planned testing on the Holesky and Sepolia testnets goes as planned. In a recent all-core developer call, ethereum’s core builders planned to conduct the first test of Pectra on the Holesky testnet on February 26, followed by a second test on the Sepolia testnet on March 5. If testing goes smoothly, developers will meet again on March 6 to finalize the mainnet activation date. Tim Beiko, head of protocol support at the Ethereum Foundation, said early April is the most likely target.

Pectra is a hybrid of the Prague and Electra upgrades, introducing eight Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) designed to enhance wallet functionality and validator efficiency.

One ​​of the most anticipated changes is EIP-7702, which is designed to simplify the user experience and allow externally owned accounts (including most Crypto wallets) to operate more like smart contracts.

The improvement is part of a broader push for account abstraction, a blockchain trend that aims to make wallets more flexible by letting users pay transaction fees with assets other than ETH.

EIP-7251 is another important update, which increases the deposit limit for validators from 32 ETH to 2048 ETH.

The change is expected to ease network congestion and allow large validators to consolidate operations and reduce the long queues currently required to set up new nodes.

The Pectra upgrade comes at a time when Ethereum has been underperforming against BTC and competing smart contract networks and has attracted much attention.

Competitors such as Solana have gained momentum in recent months, attracting attention and talent from the Ethereum ecosystem.

Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation is also undergoing a major transition in leadership, further adding to uncertainty about the long-term direction of the project.

The foundation has also been criticized in recent months for selling ETH, especially during market downturns.

Through Pectra, **developers hope to reaffirm Ethereum’s dominance as the leading smart contract blockchain**.

If all goes as planned, the upgrade will strengthen Ethereum’s technical advantages, increase user adoption, and address some of the network’s biggest pain points.

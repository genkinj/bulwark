Trump Media Aims to Launch ETF s This Year
==========================================

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), founded in 2021 and majority-owned by [US President Donald Trump](https://www.coinlive.com/news/anti-crypto-elizabeth-warren-s-surprising-alignment-with-pro-crypto-donald-trump-on ), announced plans to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and separately managed accounts (SMAs), including products tied to Bitcoin (BTC).

[According to a 6 February announcement,](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/02/06/3022027/0/en/Trump-Media-Registers-Trademarks-for-Truth-Fi-Investment-Vehicles.html ) TMTG has filed trademark registrations for various financial products under its Truth Social platform and Truth+ video streaming service.

These include the Truth.Fi Made in America ETF, Truth.Fi US Energy Independence ETF, and Truth.Fi Bitcoin Plus ETF, alongside corresponding SMAs.

While the company aims to roll out these offerings in 2025, it has not provided a specific timeline.

The [US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](https://www.coinlive.com/news/sec-s-new-crypto-task-force-aims-for-regulatory-reset-sets ) will review and approve the filings once submitted.

TMTG Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes, who also chairs the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, stated that the initiative seeks to offer alternatives to what he described as a politically influenced financial system.

The focus, he emphasized, will be on investments in American energy, manufacturing, and companies positioned to counteract “woke funds” and debanking issues.

In a statement, Nunes said:

> “We aim to give investors a means to invest in American energy, manufacturing, and other firms that provide a competitive alternative to the woke funds and debanking problems that you find throughout the market, We’re exploring a range of ways to differentiate our products, including strategies related to bitcoin.”

Bitcoin-related strategies will play a key role in differentiating TMTG’s financial products, aligning with the company's broader “America First” investment principles.

The proposed [Truth.Fi](https://www.coinlive.com/news/trump-media-ventures-into-financial-services-with-launch-of-truth-fi ) funds are expected to launch with an initial investment of up to $250 million, held in custody by Charles Schwab.

This represents more than 35% of TMTG’s reported $700 million in cash reserves.

Yorkville Advisors, based in New Jersey, will serve as the registered investment adviser, overseeing product development and regulatory compliance.

Mark Angelo, Yorkville President, noted:

> “Yorkville is pleased to take this next important step with TMTG in its development of America First investment vehicles. We greatly value our position as a strategic financial partner to TMTG and are proud to join with TMTG in the Truth.Fi movement.”

The new financial products will operate under the Truth.Fi brand, which TMTG describes as central to its broader financial services and fintech strategy.

What is the Difference Between Bitcojn ETF & Bitcoin Plus ETF?

A [Bitcoin ETF](https://www.coinlive.com/news/which-bitcoin-etf-is-better-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the ) is a financial product that tracks the price of Bitcoin.

When you invest in a Bitcoin ETF, you are essentially buying shares that represent Bitcoin without actually owning the cryptocurrency itself.

It is a way for people to invest in Bitcoin through traditional stock markets without dealing with crypto wallets or exchanges.

A Bitcoin Plus ETF, on the other hand, likely includes Bitcoin but adds other investments to the mix.

The "Plus" could mean it invests in related assets like other cryptocurrencies, blockchain companies, or tech stocks tied to the crypto industry.

It might also use different strategies, like leveraging or hedging, to try to enhance returns or manage risks.

In short:

Bitcoin ETF = Just tracks Bitcoin's price.

Bitcoin Plus ETF = Bitcoin plus other crypto-related investments or strategies.

Industry Experts Weigh In
=========================

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas weighed in on TMTG’s recent moves, predicting the company will soon file for its proposed ETFs.

He highlighted the Truth.Fi [Bitcoin](https://www.coinlive.com/news/which-bitcoin-etf-is-better-an-in-depth-analysis-of-the ) Plus ETF as a notable development, dubbing it the first ETF issuer with direct ties to a sitting US President, given Trump’s majority ownership in TMTG.

However, Balchunas tempered expectations, suggesting that while the ETF is significant symbolically, it is unlikely to attract the same level of assets as established Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, or others managed by leading asset firms.

> One other note about this: Despite Trump's brand, these will likely be microscopic in asset gathering compared to IBIT, FBTC et al. That said, just the fact they launching it adds to the mainstreamification narrative, which matters.

Balchunas emphasized that TMTG is not synonymous with the White House, but Trump’s connection to the company gives it a unique political edge.

Still, he anticipates TMTG’s [Bitcoin](https://www.coinlive.com/news/thailand-s-sec-considering-bitcoin-etfs-to-boost-crypto-investment-opportunities ) ETF will remain “microscopic” in comparison to competitors in terms of asset accumulation.

Echoing this sentiment, Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, remarked that the convergence of ETFs and crypto represents one of the most dynamic areas in asset management today.

> I continue to say...  
>   
> There's no more interesting place in asset management right now than the intersection b/w ETFs & crypto.

As [Trump](https://www.coinlive.com/news/anti-crypto-elizabeth-warren-s-surprising-alignment-with-pro-crypto-donald-trump-on ) dives deeper into this evolving financial landscape, critical questions emerge: Is this a calculated expansion into untapped markets, or is the president overextending his influence beyond politics?

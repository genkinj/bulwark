TMTG CEO and Chairman of the Board Devin Nunes said: "Our goal is to provide investors with access to U.S. energy, manufacturing and other companies that can provide a competitive alternative to the 'woke funds' and de-banking issues prevalent in the market.

We are exploring a variety of ways to differentiate our products, including strategies related to Bitcoin. We will continue to optimize our planned product lineup to create investment options that best align with the 'America First' principle."

Yorkville President Mark Angelo said: "Yorkville is pleased to work with Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said TMTG’s Bitcoin ETF may not gain the same traction as companies like BlackRock, but it will still be significant. 

“Despite the Trump brand, these projects may be insignificant in terms of asset aggregation compared to IBIT, FBTC, etc. That being said, the fact that they launched this project itself adds content to the mainstreaming narrative, which is important. ”

In the field of digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been dominating the market, but Solana is rising rapidly, attracting the attention of a large number of investors and developers. With innovative technology and strong market demand, Solana is becoming an emerging force in the blockchain industry. This article will analyze Solana's market performance during 2023-2025 and provide investors with an outlook. 

****Key Vocabulary****
----------------------


**Realized Market Cap**: A valuation indicator, realized market cap is an indicator that measures the cumulative net capital flow since the project was launched, reflecting the actual capital inflow into the market. 

**Dynamic realized market value**: A valuation indicator, dynamic realized market value mainly evaluates two aspects of digital assets, first, the number of active accounts holding the digital asset within 7 days, and second, the scale of new market demand. 

****Price performance and growth rate****
-----------------------------------------


**Since January 2023, mainstream assets BTC, ETH, and SOL have all had large net asset inflows, among which Bitcoin still ranks first in terms of net asset inflow. However, among mainstream assets, Solana has become one of the fastest growing digital assets in terms of currency price performance and ecological growth rate.**

****Realized Cap****
--------------------

The following figure is the Realized Cap heat map of mainstream assets since January 2023:

* Bitcoin: The realized market value is 843 billion, an increase of 121% from the initial 381 billion.
* Ethereum: The realized market value is 256 billion, an increase of 45% from the initial 176 billion.
* Solana: The realized market value is 83 billion, an increase of 295% from the initial 21 billion.

From the heat map distribution, Bitcoin still occupies a dominant position. From the growth rate, Solana's growth performance is very impressive.

****Dynamic realized market value ("Hot" Realized Cap)****
----------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic realized market value is an evaluation indicator used to evaluate the market's new funds and new retail demand. The following chart compares the dynamic realized market value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana: When Bitcoin reached a new high of $100,000, new Bitcoin holders had a holding value of 99.6 billion, an increase of 119.91% from 45.3 billion in the previous cycle. Ethereum's dynamic realized market value did not reach a new high compared to the previous cycle, and Solana's dynamic realized market value reached a new high of 15.8 billion in this cycle. It is easy to see from the chart that the market demand for Solana and BTC has increased significantly. The demand for ETH is neutral, and the market performance is not as good as in the previous cycle. Therefore, it can be concluded that more investors tend to hold Solana and BTC, especially Solana has become the first choice for investors. 

****Retail Investor Activity and Holdings****
---------------------------------------------

In this cycle, Solana surpassed Ethereum in terms of capital acquisition for the first time, demonstrating its strong market demand and growing importance. Activecapitalinflows are the main factor driving Solana's growth and outperforming Ethereum.  And it can be found that Sol/Eth (the ratio of one Sol to one Eth) has been steadily increasing, indicating that Sol's price performance has also been steadily improving.

****Number of active addresses****

Solana's number of active addresses far exceeds that of Bitcoin and Ethereum in this cycle. Solana's daily active addresses are approximately 12.3M, while Bitcoin's daily active addresses are approximately 760k, and Ethereum's daily active addresses are approximately 501k. Data shows that Solana's daily active addresses are 16 times more than Bitcoin, and 24.6 times more than Ethereum.

****Transaction demand and asset transfer volume****
----------------------------------------------------

Transaction feesincrease: Solana's transaction fees have risen several times, indicating strong demand for its network. At the same time, the sharp increase in transaction volume shows that more users are participatingin the Sol ecosystem. 

#### ******Summary******

Solana's ecosystem performed exceptionally well in 2023-2025, with impressive growth in Realized Cap, even surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum, highlighting its new position in the digital asset market. As retail holdings and active addresses continue to grow, Solana's market appeal has become increasingly strong. In addition, strong trading demand and continued growth in asset transfers further verify the activity and user engagement of the Solana ecosystem, showing strong growth momentum and huge development potential. Solana is not only breaking through existing limitations, but is also rapidly becoming a core force that cannot be ignored in the future blockchain track.

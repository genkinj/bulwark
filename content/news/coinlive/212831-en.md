DeepSeek, is fighting for the brightest minds in China by luring them with attractive remuneration and the once in a lifetime opportunity to shape the future of China's artificial intelligence.

Since its popularity boom, DeepSeek has become one of the most sought after tech start-ups and the prime destinations for young jobseekers. The strong appeal of DeepSeek was evident immediately after the Lunar New Year break, as eager applicants arrived at its headquarters, hoping to secure a job or explore potential partnerships.

Liu Yuanjie, a recent automation graduate from Hangzhou, said

> ‚ÄúIf I get the chance to meet them, I‚Äôd love to ask if they have plans to develop AI agents.‚Äù

Another applicant, surnamed Shen, drove four days from Sichuan province to apply, calling DeepSeek ‚Äúthe nation‚Äôs pride‚Äù for its AI advancements. He expressed his willingness to take any role, even ‚Äúas a cleaner or driver,‚Äù just to be part of the company.

The company has recently opened multiple positions in artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and development at its headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, and its Beijing office, according to job listings from parent company High-Flyer Quant and various Chinese recruitment platforms.

AI talent in high demand amid china‚Äôs competitive job market
============================================================

DeepSeek‚Äôs rising profile has strengthened its ability to attract top talent at a time when China‚Äôs AI industry is facing a talent shortage.

Despite an increasing number of job openings in the AI sector, there are just not enough qualified professionals to fill all the spots, according to a report from Maimai, China‚Äôs equivalent of LinkedIn.

In order to lure the hearts of the Chinese youth, DeepSeek has offered to dish out highly competitive salaries for all of its employees. For example, a "deep-learning researcher in AGI" role at its Beijing office lists a monthly salary of up to 100,000 yuan (US$13,909) for candidates with a master‚Äôs degree and research papers published in world-class journals.

Meanwhile, positions in deep-learning systems, data research, and full-stack development offer annual salary packages ranging from 700,000 yuan to 1.2 million yuan.

During an interview, DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng also revealed that he prioritizes creativity over experience when he is looking for a potential employee. In fact, he said that he wants to lead his company with Gen Z, bookworms and humanities graduates because of the creativity and the innovation they can bring to the table.

> "When doing something, experienced people will tell you without hesitation that you should do it one way. But inexperienced people will repeatedly explore and think seriously about how to do it, and then find a solution that suits the current situation."

> "If you're pursuing short-term goals, finding experienced people is the right move. But for the long term, experience isn't that important. Good foundational skills, creativity and passion are much more important - there's plenty in China."

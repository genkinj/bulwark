According to professional statistics, almost all cryptocurrency trading players have been in a loss since the Spring Festival. Compared with large institutions and large funds, ordinary players are a disadvantaged group in cryptocurrency trading and it is difficult to make a profit.

Facing the current cryptocurrency market, some smart players in the currency circle prefer to play those projects that are powerful, promising and have not yet issued coins. The current Telegram game Elfbird has attracted much attention. Since its launch at the end of October last year, Elfbird has achieved a lot of results and has been moving forward steadily.

Since its launch, Elfbird has experienced at least two relatively large cryptocurrency bear markets. Under these market conditions, most cryptocurrency traders have been losing money, and many projects have died halfway. But Elfbird not only moves forward steadily, but also allows users who play Elfbird to make huge profits.

Whether a blockchain project is valuable and has huge potential, the number of its users is an important criterion for measuring it. Compared with other projects, Elfbird firmly believes that the number of users is the key to the success of a project, so it has always chosen to deploy the project on the Telegram platform. Telegram's billions of users around the world are a constant source of nutrients for Elfbird's future development. Although the current overall cryptocurrency market is not ideal, this does not affect Elfbird's stable and long-term development.

Since its launch, Elfbird has been launched on the Telegram miniapp mall, the tonapp mall, the bitget miniapp mall, and has obtained CARV support, etc. Since its launch, its functions have been continuously updated and improved, and many interesting and fun functions have been launched, such as color bird synthesis, color bird trading market, bird egg C2C trading market, bird hospital, lucky wheel, etc.

The launch of these functions not only increases the fun and user stickiness of Elfbird, but also further improves the Elfbird ecosystem, giving Elfbird a more stable and long-term development potential.

With the coming of the new year, more new functions of Elfbird will be gradually launched. For example, the efficient treatment in the bird hospital will be launched on February 10. Efficient treatment will greatly shorten the treatment time and give users more strategies and choices. After the launch of efficient treatment, special effect needles will also be launched soon. Other interesting and fun functions are also under intensive development.

Elfbird will also seek more cooperation with other projects this year and increase publicity efforts. In the future, the ecology and influence of Elfbird will continue to expand. Elfbird is destined to be a long-term and stable project in terms of layout and development. Compared with trading cryptocurrencies, Elfbird will not be affected by the downturn brought by the bear market, but will be more popular due to its stable characteristics. Such a project not only requires less investment, but also has unimaginable rich returns after the token is issued in the future. In the new year, Elfbird will start a new journey. Not afraid of the bear market, Elfbird will move forward steadily and open a new chapter.

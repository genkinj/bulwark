I am in Davos now, and U.S. President Donald Trump addressed delegates online on Thursday, emphasizing that the United States will become the world's cryptocurrency capital. A few hours later, the White House issued a much-anticipated executive order on digital assets. Since winning the election in November, Trump and his team have sent all the right smoke signals, including appointing David Sacks as the White House director of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI). Under the Biden administration, the cryptocurrency industry's biggest complaint is unclear regulation and enforcement supervision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Trump administration intends to fill regulatory gaps in the early days of his presidency and promote a broader deregulatory agenda in the field of innovation.  

With lawmakers expressing support for the industry—including House Financial Services Committee Chair Rep. French Hill (watch his Atlantic Council event on stablecoins here), new Senate Banking Committee Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Senator Cynthia Lummis, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, and advisors like Elon Musk and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick—there’s growing confidence that a crypto-forward agenda is on the horizon. But what exactly does regulatory success look like? And what would it mean for the rest of the world? We dive into the dozen bills currently before Congress and focus on three major themes for cryptocurrency regulation in 2025. 

**SEC****vs****CFTC****: A Truce at Last?**
-------------------------------------------

One ​​of the main disagreements between industry and lawmakers is whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the appropriate regulator for cryptocurrencies. As is often debated in Washington, are cryptocurrencies securities or commodities? Under former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the agency regularly fined cryptocurrency companies when it found them violating securities laws. This led some lawmakers and the industry to favor the CFTC as the regulator. Several bills under consideration, including the 21st Century Financial Innovation and Technology Act, the Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, and the BRIDGE Digital Assets Act, all address the SEC and CFTC’s jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies.

One ​​of the Trump campaign’s biggest promises to the cryptocurrency industry is to end this era of enforcement regulation. Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to succeed Gary Gensler as SEC chairman, is seen as friendly to the cryptocurrency industry. His appointment comes after a series of legal rulings over the past two years that favor companies and are unfavorable to the SEC. Once sworn in, Atkins will have dual duties: He’ll need to clarify the SEC’s jurisdiction over the cryptocurrency market and then actually enforce regulation of crypto assets — their issuance, use, and role in the U.S. economy. Congress will ramp up these efforts, and you can expect several bills to rebalance the jurisdiction and enforcement powers of the SEC and CFTC. See below for a full breakdown. 

**Hello, Stablecoins!**
-----------------------

Stablecoins now have over $190 billion in circulation globally. They can provide much-needed liquidity to cryptocurrency markets and act as a conduit between crypto and non-crypto assets. Stablecoins are increasingly being used to address humanitarian aid and cross-border payments, such as remittances to Ukraine. 

While 98% of stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar, over 80% of stablecoin transactions take place abroad. This makes these “digital dollars” subject to regulatory frameworks developed in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Europe’s framework for stablecoins, the cryptoasset market, fully takes effect in January 2025. Implementing the framework should lead to some rethinking across the Atlantic about stablecoin legislation being considered in Congress. The Payments Stablecoin Clarity Act and the Loomis-Gillibrand Payments Stablecoin Act are two of the bills being considered. The Clarity Act has been on the House Financial Services Committee's radar for the past year, coming close to bipartisan consensus several times. It has evolved into a discussion draft introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty. The Loomis-Gillibrand Act is due to be introduced in the Senate in May 2024. As our Crypto Regulation Tracker shows, regulation in the United States, more than anything else, plays a key role in the future of cryptocurrencies around the world. While other countries have been developing their own regulatory frameworks, the United States has lagged behind — a situation that may finally change in the coming months.  

**Groundbreaking National Bitcoin Reserve**
-------------------------------------------

With Lummis’ appointment as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, Congress is likely to continue to debate the Bitcoin reserve issue. The logic behind the bill is to buy Bitcoin to pay down the national debt. There are still some unanswered questions about Lummis’ Bitcoin reserve proposal—including a complex funding model that revalues ​​gold certificates from 1993 prices to current values.  

In addition, there are proposals for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have made it clear that a retail CBDC or digital dollar will not be in the U.S. This puts the U.S. at odds with peers such as Europe, which is set to launch a digital euro pilot in 2025, and the U.K., which just launched a CBDC lab last week. The executive order instructs all institutions to cease any ongoing CBDC work. 

A breakdown of all the major legislation currently under consideration is below.

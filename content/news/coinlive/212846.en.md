Author: The DeFi Investor Source: thedefinvestor Translation: Shan Ouba, Golden Finance

This market cycle has been quite tough for **ETH**.

At the **bottom of the 2022 bear market**, many had predicted that ETH would easily break through **$10,000** in this bull run. But now, the market is full of doubts about whether ETH can even set new highs this year.

**Given the current market sentiment, this skepticism is reasonable.**

As **Ignas** mentioned in a recent post, **even ETC (Ethereum Classic) has outperformed ETH recently**.

**Don't get me wrong, I have always been a loyal supporter of the Ethereum ecosystem. But in my opinion, ETH's weak performance shows that it needs major changes.** 

So why did **ETH perform poorly in this cycle?** 

**Why did ETH perform poorly in this cycle?**
---------------------------------------------

No one can give a definite answer, but I think there are mainly the following reasons:

**1. There are too many ETH Beta tokens and funds are diverted**

In the past, most ETH supporters would hold **ETH** directly, but now, **almost all Ethereum L2s have issued their own tokens**, and many investors have begun to buy L2 tokens instead of ETH. This has led to a **substantial reduction** in the flow of funds into ETH.

For example, if you are bullish on Solana, you only need to buy **SOL** because it does not have L2. But if you are bullish on ETH, you have **dozens of L2 tokens to choose from**.

**2. Dispersed liquidity**

**There are more than 100 Ethereum L2 projects, but interoperability and liquidity between L2s are still a big problem.**

For veteran DeFi users, bridging funds across different L2s is not a big problem, but for ordinary investors, the process is extremely complicated and even a nightmare. Currently, L2 transactions are fast and low-cost, but if the cross-L2 user experience (UX) is not significantly improved, L2 expansion cannot truly promote the mainstream adoption of Ethereum.

**3. Other L1 blockchains are catching up**

In the last cycle, Ethereum was undoubtedly the **absolute king** of all L1 public chains.

**Although Ethereum still has the strongest DeFi ecosystem, L1s such as Solana have now surpassed Ethereum in indicators such as revenue and DEX trading volume.**

This is because **Solana and other L1s have made faster technical progress**, and although Ethereum has made some progress in the past few years, **some competitors are faster and the user experience is far better than Ethereum**.

**How to make ETH great again?**
--------------------------------

Here are several possible solutions:

* **Encourage L2 to support ETH by destroying part of the transaction fees** (Vitalik once suggested supporting more dApps that use ETH as the main collateral)
* **Strengthen ETH's core position in the Ethereum economy** (ETH should become the cornerstone asset of the L2 ecosystem, not an L2 token)
* **Invest more resources to solve the problem of L2 liquidity dispersion and unify the L2 funding pool** (this is the top priority)
* **Accelerate Ethereum upgrade iterations** (Ethereum destroys more than **$100 million** of ETH, but the upgrade speed is still lagging behind other L1s)
* **Let the Ethereum Foundation establish a sustainable revenue model** (such as obtaining funds from transaction fees and staking income to avoid selling ETH)
* **At the same time, expand Ethereum L1** (although the main expansion direction of Ethereum is L2, L1 can still further improve performance through optimization)

**If these changes can be promoted, ETH may usher in a strong rebound.** 

In the past few years, the Ethereum Foundation and the community **seem to be a little complacent**, which may **weaken Ethereum's competitiveness** in the long run.

**While ETH remains the leader in the L1 space, other L1s are catching up at a faster pace, and if Ethereum does not adjust its strategy, it may lose the L1 war.** 

However, we have seen some positive developments, especially from projects within the ecosystem, which are working to improve market sentiment towards ETH:

**MegaETH** - Building a high-performance Ethereum L2 with the goal of **supporting 100,000+ TPS** to compete with highly scalable L1s.

**Eclipse** - The **first Ethereum L2 based on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)**, combining the speed of Solana with the security of Ethereum.

**Pectra Upgrade** - Ethereum's next major upgrade, **will introduce Native Account Abstraction, greatly improving the user experience**.

**Eric Trump publicly supports ETH** - This raises the question: **Will the United States establish a "National Ethereum Reserve"?**

The first three technical upgrades will undoubtedly **promote the adoption of Ethereum L2**, but the real question is:

**Can they drive up the price of ETH?**

**Can the price of ETH recover? The key depends on two points**

**1. Solve the problem of L2 liquidity dispersion** (cross-L2 experience must be significantly improved)

**2. Optimize the ETH token economic model** (such as letting L2 contribute part of the transaction fee to destroy ETH to reduce the supply)

At present, I am not heavily invested in ETH because I prefer to bet on **faster growing DeFi tokens (such as FLUID)**.

But historically, **ETH's rise often triggers a round of "altcoin season"**, which is good for all investors holding altcoins.

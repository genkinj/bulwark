KOLs are influential, and some of their behaviors will have a certain impact on the project. Under normal circumstances, a project is generally bought by KOLs themselves first, then shared in the community, and finally shared on public channels such as Twitter. If we have the address of the KOL, we can know what he bought, when to add positions, and when to stop profit and stop loss.

This article shares some methods to find KOL addresses and how to use them.

1. Use gmgn
-----------

gmgn is a comprehensive platform with trading, data analysis, monitoring and other functions. The boss is Brother Ji @haze0x.

On gmgn, users can bind Twitter accounts and addresses. We can use this function to find the address of KOLs.

For example, if we want to know the address of 0xsun, we can enter "0xsun" in the search box, and the address of 0xsun will appear in the search results at the bottom, as shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886300302.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

Click on the address in the search results to see the detailed information of 0xsun's address, as shown in the figure. We can see the number of his Twitter followers, and click on it to jump to Twitter; we can see his winning rate; we can see his 7-day profit and loss, and the 7-day profit is 2.3 million US dollars.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886308471.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

In this way, when we want to know the address of a certain KOL, we can search on gmgn to see if he has bound the address. If so, we can find it out.

Second, use chain.fm
--------------------

chain.fm is an on-chain monitoring platform. Users have uploaded a lot of smart money addresses, including many KOL addresses. The boss is @zen913.

Years ago, chain.fm launched a search function that supports keyword search, so we can use this function to find the address of KOL.

This method is mentioned in this tweet of mine https://x.com/0x\_zibu/status/1882345639218118884

There are two ways to find KOL addresses using chain.fm:

### 1. Directly search for a specific KOL name

Let’s continue to take 0xsun as an example. Enter "0xsun" in the input box and you can see that several addresses appear, as shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886321200.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

The first address in the search result is 426 If it is included in a channel, then it is basically most likely 0xsun's address. We can also verify it on gmgn to see if 0xsun himself has authenticated this address.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886331089.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

### 2. Search with the keyword "KOL"

We can also enter the keyword "KOL" to find all relevant information on chain.fm, as shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886343330.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

When we enter "KOL", all related channels will be found, and the channels are all KOLs organized by the channel owners The address, we just need to verify the authenticity.

Under the wallet options, the keyword "KOL" will also find the address with this information, as shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886350947.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

The address found through chain.fm is based on the channel owner's upload, and there is no guarantee that it is 100% true. We need to cross-verify it through gmgn, Twitter or other channels.

Third, based on Twitter's clues analysis
----------------------------------------

The above two methods are relatively simple, as long as you are willing to spend time to sort it out, you can find it. However, some KOLs do not actively disclose their addresses. In this case, you have to find them in other ways.

### 1. Clear order exposure

Some KOLs will post their orders in their tweets, and the pictures will contain specific transaction information, such as transaction time, buy or sell, transaction amount, and the number of coins. It is particularly easy to find orders that are posted, because there is specific transaction information, and we only need to filter based on this information.

For order screening, we recommend using Eagle (https://dexscreener.com/), we can do detailed screening based on transaction time, transaction type (buy or sell), transaction amount, and the number of transaction coins, as shown in the figure.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886375636.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

Eagle has the most abundant manual screening functions among the tools I have used. Unlike other tools, the screening function is purely for display. I guess PMs don’t even use it.

However, the disadvantage of Eagle is that it cannot find transactions that use aggregate routing, such as OKX. For this kind of transaction, you can only go to OKX’s website (https://www.okx.com/zh-hans/web3) to find it.

### 2. Fuzzy information

Sometimes KOLs will not directly post orders on Twitter, but may mention that a certain coin was listed at a certain market value. In this case, the information is limited. Based on a single tweet, we can only filter out the approximate range. We may need to combine multiple tweets to filter out the specific address. For example, Cycle Hand Niu Niu tweeted about Burder's address yesterday, as shown in the figure. How can we find this address?

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886388332.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

Let’s collect all the valid information first:

(1) The tweet time is 2.5 9:53

(2) According to the tweet, Burder first bought $Ncat and $Noland, and then bought $Calicoin

(3) The picture in the tweet provides a lot of information, as shown in the figure. We can know:

a. $Calicoin’s holdings are 4M

b. $Noland’s holdings are 37.6M

c. $Ncat’s holdings are 30M, but only account for 57% of the holdings

d. When the screenshot was taken, their holding time was only 2 minutes

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886402940.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

(4) The opening time of $Calicoin is 2.5 8:23

b. Use dune (https://dune.com/) to query

Compared to writing scripts to get transaction data, the data on dune is ready-made. At this time, you can use the helper ai to write dune query statements, filter out the addresses, and then verify them manually.

Fourth, analyze the address trading style and winning rate and other indicators
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After finding the address of the KOL, we need to analyze this address in detail. See what his trading style is, whether he likes to play the inner disk or the outer disk one or the outer disk two; whether he likes to chase high or like to ambush; how to stop profit and stop loss; what is the winning rate; what is the overall profit and loss situation.

Analysis of address At present, the better platforms can use gmgn and debot.

### 1. gmgn

gmgn has done a lot of data analysis, with various indicators.

For example, for the address of 0xsun, we can see his 1-day, 7-day and 30-day profit and loss, winning rate, and total profit and loss. In the recent profit and loss, you can see the transaction currencies of 30 days, which can be sorted according to various indicators. Click on a certain coin to see detailed transaction records. As shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886436677.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

### 2. debot

debot implements the same function as gmgn. The two are slightly different in algorithm and there are some discrepancies in the displayed data. The data of 0xsun address is shown in the figure, which can be compared with gmgn.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886450323.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

As for which one is better, gmgn or debot, my suggestion is to use both together and refer to each other to prevent the missing or wrong data of a single tool from affecting the analysis.

V. Monitoring
-------------

After finding the address of the KOL and performing data analysis, we need to label and classify each address, and then use tools to monitor these addresses, so that when they have transactions, we can know it in the first time, which can be earlier than social media and Twitter.

For monitoring, debot is strongly recommended. Debot is the most feature-rich and granular product currently used. Its AI signal is also very strong and the transaction is also very smooth.

Debot's wallet monitoring is divided into two types: wallet behavior monitoring and wallet group behavior monitoring, as shown in the figure

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886466010.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

### 1. Wallet behavior monitoring

This monitoring is a common monitoring that all tools have, but other tools monitor all addresses and push them to a tg group. The advantage of debot is that it can group addresses and then push them to different tg groups according to the grouping situation, as shown in the figure.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886476413.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

In this way, different tg groups can be established for push according to the marking situation, such as internal players, external second-stage players, key focus addresses, etc. A tool that can classify monitoring information is a good tool. When I used abot for monitoring before, in order to achieve the effect of group push, I would first mark the address, and then the tg group would do secondary development after receiving the monitoring message, and do secondary distribution according to the marking. Now with debot, there is no need to do secondary development.

### 2. Wallet group behavior monitoring

If we monitor more addresses, there is an unavoidable problem: too many push messages. If there are too many messages and the human brain can't handle them, they will want to give up, which makes monitoring meaningless. For this problem, my previous strategy was to do secondary development of the pushed messages, setting them to be pushed when the number of different addresses reaches a certain number within a certain time period, such as if 5 different addresses buy within 30 minutes. I used this strategy for about a year, and the effect is very good. It reduces a lot of messages, and at the same time will not miss the hot coins.

debot's wallet grouping behavior monitoring just implements my above strategy, and it is more refined and the indicator granularity is finer, as shown in the figure. We can monitor according to buying and selling, and can set the monitoring time period, transaction amount, notification frequency, and market value. It can fully meet various monitoring needs, and this function is highly recommended.

Six, Hundreds of KOL Address Files
----------------------------------

According to the above method, I sorted out the addresses of nearly 100 KOLs, as shown in the figure.

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202502/5-1738886497265.webp?x-oss-process=style/scale70)

You can analyze and mark each address according to the analysis method in the fourth part, and find the address that suits your habits for monitoring.

VII. Summary
------------

The above article introduces how to find the KOL address, and also explains how to analyze and monitor the address. For the KOL address that is not included in the file, you can use the above method to find it. In addition, the KOL's external address is only one of the addresses they use. Everyone has multiple addresses. You can find their associated addresses based on the above address. If you collect more, your address library will be very rich.

Each KOL has a different style. Some KOLs will also cut orders. You can't blindly believe in the KOL address. You still have to choose the one that suits you.

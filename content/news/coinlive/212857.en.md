*Jessy ([@susanliu33](https://x.com/susanliu33)), Golden Finance*

Half a month has passed since Trump was officially sworn in as the President of the United States on January 20. During this period, the crypto market has also been on a roller coaster ride. Especially after Trump announced the increase in tariffs, the cryptocurrency circle was shaken and the crypto circle fell into a wailing, shouting "the bear market has come".

After Trump came to power, although he fulfilled his campaign promises about the crypto industry, he did not bring too much confidence to the industry. Even because of the plunge caused by his tariff increase, some confusions such as "Is Trump's coming to power a blessing or a curse for cryptocurrencies" spread in the cryptocurrency circle.

On the one hand, as the President of the United States, Trump is actively promoting the introduction of friendly laws and regulations related to the crypto industry, but these benefits seem to be "less than expected". On the other hand, companies related to the Trump family are actively deploying the crypto industry, especially issuing Meme coins. The WLFI project is clearly using crypto to make money.

At present, the market fluctuates with Trump's every move. Trump himself may not have thought that in such an industry that regards decentralization as a criterion, he is regarded as an emperor and has supreme power.

**As president, Trump is actively fulfilling his campaign promises on crypto**

Since taking office for half a month, Trump has indeed been gradually promoting the implementation of crypto-related policies and regulations, and those promises he made during the campaign have indeed been fulfilled one by one. Such as banning central bank digital currency, firing Gary Gensler, then chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and establishing a Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Advisory Committee. A series of policies that are beneficial to the development of the crypto industry in the United States are being implemented step by step.

Specifically, on January 23, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to establish a working group under the National Economic Council, chaired by David Sacks, the "AI and Cryptocurrency Tsar" of the White House, and members include the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of the SEC, etc. The task of the working group is to develop a federal regulatory framework to manage digital assets (including stablecoins) and evaluate the possibility of creating a national digital asset reserve.

At the first press conference on digital assets held by David Sacks and several U.S. congressional lawmakers on Capitol Hill on February 4, David Sacks first examined the feasibility of Bitcoin reserves, but he pointed out that the initiative is still in its early stages.

At the meeting, U.S. Senator Bill Hagerty also proposed a bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill would bring tokens such as Tether and USDC into the regulatory rules of the Federal Reserve. The bill also stipulates the reserve requirements for stablecoin issuers-adopting the regulatory framework of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for issuers that issue more than $10 billion in stablecoins, establishing supervision, inspection and enforcement mechanisms, etc.

In terms of legislation, it is planned to promote a new round of legislation based on the market structure legislation "FIT21" bill passed by the House Financial Services Committee last year, and is committed to bringing "clarity" to the regulatory framework. It is reported that cryptocurrency legislation is expected to be introduced within six months.

In addition to setting up a working group, in the encryption-related executive order signed on January 23, it clearly prohibits the establishment, issuance or promotion of central bank digital currency in the United States. It also clarifies the free use of public chains by American citizens-allowing citizens to develop and deploy software, participate in mining, transactions and self-custody of digital assets.

The Trump administration's crypto-friendliness is not only reflected in administrative legislation. On February 4, the SEC was exposed to have reduced its department dedicated to crypto enforcement, transferring or demoting more than 50 lawyers and staff. This is also one of Trump's first concrete measures to relax crypto regulation.

However, the introduction of the above measures did not bring great excitement to the market. What the market is most looking forward to is the real implementation of the national Bitcoin strategic reserve. However, David Sacks also stated that the national Bitcoin strategic reserve is still in the early stage of preparation. However, the US states have already set off a competition for Bitcoin strategic reserves. For example, eleven states have proposed relevant bills, and two of them have entered the committee approval stage. For example, Pennsylvania proposed a bill allowing the state treasury to use 10% of its funds to purchase Bitcoin; Texas piloted green energy mining subsidies. The federal level proposed the "Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act", which plans to purchase a total of 1 million Bitcoins within five years and promote the "Bitcoin Energy and Technology Innovation Act" to support green mining.

On February 3, Trump also announced the establishment of the US sovereign wealth fund. Industry insiders analyzed that the US sovereign wealth fund is likely to invest in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

Overall, Trump is indeed actively fulfilling his promise to the crypto community during the campaign, but when it comes to the national Bitcoin strategic reserve, legislation needs to follow a fixed process. It's just that the crypto industry can't seem to wait any longer. Before the major benefit of the national Bitcoin strategic reserve appears, it has fallen first.

**Trump is not only a president, but also a businessman**

As president, Trump, a former businessman, cannot personally participate in business operations. But he can hand over his business empire to his family for management, which is in line with US law.

After Trump officially took office as the US President, the main operation of his family's crypto business is the WLFI project. According to the WLFI token issuance agreement, the Trump family will receive 75% of the net income left after deducting operating expenses and the initial reserve of $30 million, and these incomes will belong to DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company under the Trump family. Secondly, the Trump family will receive 22.5 billion WLFI tokens, which are worth $337.5 million based on the issuance price of 1.5 cents.

At present, those who hold the pre-sale tokens of the project cannot transfer and trade the tokens - they are forced to lock up for one year.

The vision of the project is to do DeFi, so it has accumulated a lot of tokens in the DeFi field such as ETH, CBTC, AAVE, Ondo, ENA, etc. in the early stage. Previously, these tokens were regarded as the President's strict selection in the industry and bought in a trend. It is precisely because of the president's ability to bring goods that these tokens have become the hot cakes sought after by investors for a period of time.

And perhaps it is precisely because of the huge wealth effect brought by the "President's Strict Selection". According to Blockworks, people familiar with the matter said that the Trump family's encryption project WLFI has been in contact with the blockchain team for "token swap" transactions. This kind of transaction is simply that the project party pays money to WLFI and buys WLFI tokens, then the WLFI team will also buy the tokens specified by the project party, and the tokens that appear in the WLFI wallet will also be exposed and promoted.

TRX appeared in WLFI's coin wallet, which is the effect of "token swap". In mid-to-late January, Justin Sun invested a total of 75 million US dollars in WLFI in two times, and in early February, TRX appeared in WLFI's wallet. It is highly likely that the purchase of TRX by the WLFI project this time is a "token swap".

From the over-sale of WLFI to the "token exchange", WLFI's Sima Zhao's heart is already known to passers-by. The WLFI token itself is a project of making money out of nothing. Investors use their own value coins to exchange for WLFI tokens that can only be traded after one year. The WLFI project uses the value coins to purchase the above-mentioned ETHO, Ondo, AAVE, LINK, ENA, etc., which can be said to be free of cost. Then the decline of these tokens is just a retracement of the original profits for the WLFI project.

For the WLFI project, the decline is just a retracement of profits, but for retail investors, it is a loss. Another unexpected move by WLFI was that on the second day after Trump's second son Eric Trump called for an order for Ethereum, the WLFI wallet showed that it had transferred more than 70,000 Ethereum to Coinbase Prime. At the same time, a large number of WBTC, AAVE, LINK, ENA, Move, ONDO, and USDC were also transferred to Coinbase Prime. The relevant virtual currencies admitted to Coinbase Prime can no longer be tracked on the chain. Although the WLFI project party stated that it did not sell the cryptocurrencies it held, but was only reallocating assets, it could not be confirmed without evidence on the chain.

After taking office, in addition to "making a lot of money" in the encryption field, the Trump family is also involved in the traditional financial industry. On February 6, Trump's social media company Truth announced that it has registered 6 trademarks for its customized ETF products and separately managed account products, and specific financial products will be launched within the year. Judging from the names of several trademarks that have been launched, Trump Media Technology Group is likely to launch theme products in the three directions of US manufacturing, energy industry and Bitcoin. These products will all be part of the group’s newly established financial services brand, Truth.Fi.

Previously, Trump was the company's largest shareholder, and before he was sworn in last month, Trump had transferred all of his shares to a trust controlled by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.

However, at present, these ETFs themselves have not yet entered the application process, but have only applied for trademarks, and even if these ETFs are finally approved, how much money will flow into them is still in doubt.

However, all of the above actions also illustrate that the Trump family is actively involved in traditional finance and crypto finance. However, it is still difficult to predict how much volume its products can have.

However, from issuing Meme coins before taking office to various actions of his family after taking office, it is clear that Trump's most fundamental background is a businessman, and profit-seeking is the nature of businessmen, which is nothing to condemn.

**Summary**

Businessman is Trump's background. As a businessman, Trump will definitely make money with encryption and use his influence as president to make money.

On the other hand, as president, Trump did fulfill his promise to the encryption industry during the campaign, which also shows his promise-keeping side.

The recent market crash cannot be simply attributed to Trump's various extreme behaviors: such as issuing coins, adding tariffs, etc. Funds in the market will make choices based on various information. Trump cannot be responsible for the decline or rise. A mature investor should be responsible for his investment behavior.

At present, cryptocurrencies are increasingly integrated into the global financial market. The rise of cryptocurrencies depends not only on crypto-related policies, but also on the macroeconomic environment. At present, there are not many favorable policies for the macro-economy, and the crypto industry itself is also difficult to be immune and can only maintain a state of anxiety.

From another perspective, for an industry that advocates decentralization, watching Trump's every move every day and counting on the coveted policies of the US government, is it also a betrayal of the industry's ideals?

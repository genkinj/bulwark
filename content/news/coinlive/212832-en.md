Digital assets are not exactly like other assets. This is part of the reason why they attract many people - but can also cause confusion.

As more investors seek diversification and hedging opportunities, trying to quantify the relationship between BTC and other asset classes has become increasingly common.

There is a clear finding in a recent report from FTSE Russell: **Since 2020, the rolling correlation of Bitcoin and Ethereum returns with risk assets has risen sharply.**

If we focus specifically on BTC, the Russell 1000 Index, which is composed of large-cap U.S. stocks, has a correlation of 0.58 with the asset. BTC's correlation with U.S. financial stocks and U.S. technology stocks is almost equally strong, at 0.53 and 0.52, respectively.

Since the pandemic, BTC has a correlation of 0.49 with US High Yield Credit (the most “risky” fixed income asset class).

Before the pandemic hit (spurring inflation and monetary tightening), all of these correlations were much closer to zero.

7-10 year US Treasuries have not shown a significantly higher correlation with BTC post-COVID, which is fairly unique. The USD is the only asset that has been negatively correlated with BTC and ETH over the years.

While Bitcoin is often compared to gold, the post-pandemic BTC-gold correlation is only 0.15.

The report notes that **BTC’s high volatility (and the different importance of safe-haven and hedge characteristics in financial markets) may mask the “true correlation” between the returns of these assets.** 

It adds: “But the true correlation is likely just low, reflecting that Bitcoin and ETH are primarily risk assets, while gold has a long history of trading as a ‘safe-haven’ asset, even if they do share some common hedge characteristics.”

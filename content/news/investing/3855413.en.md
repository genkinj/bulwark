Investing.com - This energy is set for strong performance in 2025, driven by increasing data center power demand and a favorable business setup, according to analysts from Piper Sandler.The brokerage highlighted Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) and said data center demand is expected to surge by up to 75 gigawatts (GWs) across various regions by 2030, with Bloom’s ability to rapidly deploy onsite, 24/7 power positioning it advantageously in the market.Entering the fourth quarter, analysts believe Wall Street's 2025 expectations for the company are conservative, allowing management room to set guidance that could be revised higher. Additionally, Bloom Energy’s annual backlog disclosure is expected to reflect solid progress, benefiting from recent commercial successes.A key focus for investors in 2025 will be the conversion of the American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) deal, which represents a significant endorsement of Bloom’s technology, according to analysts. The 100-megawatt (MW) order, with potential upside to 1GW, is seen as a major growth driver. The firm expects the initial 100MW order to be converted in 2025, with demand from AEP’s footprint in Central Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and West Virginia increasing the likelihood of full utilization of the 1GW capacity.In the near term, Bloom Energy’s fourth-quarter setup appears decent, with Wall Street modeling the period at the low end of the company’s guidance and gross margins projected at 34%, below management’s implied forecast of 39%. Analysts noted that if margins come in stronger, the market could react positively.The firm also pointed out that Bloom Energy has less risk tied to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) compared to some peers and is directly leveraged to growing power demand from data centers. The potential for favorable estimate revisions further supports the expectation that the stock is well positioned to outperform in 2025.Investors will also closely watch developments in the competitive landscape, as traditional oilfield services players like SEI and gas turbine manufacturers such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) expand into the power supply sector. While small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are gaining traction, analysts expect them to remain a long-term solution, with deployments unlikely before the 2030s.

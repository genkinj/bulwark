Arcutis Biotherapeutics is going long with the latest push for its seborrheic dermatitis treatment Zoryve.

The drugmaker has recruited professional football player Odell Beckham Jr., who has the skin condition known as seb derm and uses the topical foam version of Zoryve to treat it, to serve as a celebrity spokesperson for the med.

The partnership—featuring the tagline “a clear win for your skin”—is intended not only to promote the use of Zoryve to treat seb derm but also to raise awareness of the skin condition itself. Seb derm is a common condition, affecting around 10 million Americans, per Arcutis, but is often misunderstood or misdiagnosed, especially as it can present differently across a range of skin tones. It can cause dandruff, scaly patches and inflamed skin, often concentrated in oil-producing areas of the body.

In a statement, Beckham described his own yearslong journey toward a correct diagnosis.

“My seborrheic dermatitis started to bother me in my 20s when I noticed white flaky skin throughout my beard and at my hairline accompanied by a deep, burning itchy sensation that was extremely uncomfortable,” he said. “After trying to figure out the cause for several years, I finally visited my dermatologist who diagnosed me with seb derm and prescribed Zoryve foam, which works really well for me.”

He continued, “Seb derm is such a common condition but like me, many people may have a hard time trying to figure out what it is and what can be done about it. I want to inspire people not to be embarrassed or discouraged about their condition and instead be empowered to find a dermatologist and work together to find a treatment that works for them.”

Arcutis earned FDA approval for Zoryve foam in late 2023, clearing it for use to treat seb derm in patients ages 9 and up and making it the “first drug approved for seborrheic dermatitis with a new mechanism of action in over two decades,” according to its maker. The medication was [previously cleared in cream form in 2022](https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/aiming-avoid-pfizers-eucrisa-failure-arcutis-wins-fda-nod-zoryve-cream-psoriasis) to treat plaque psoriasis; the cream received another clearance last summer in atopic dermatitis.

The Zoryve foam is steroid-free and can be applied virtually anywhere on the body, even on the scalp or through facial hair, to fight inflammation. In clinical trials, nearly 80% of Zoryve users achieved “clear or almost clear” skin at Week 8, compared to 53% of those who were assigned to use a foam without the active ingredient.

Arcutis previously [launched an unbranded campaign](https://www.fiercepharma.com/marketing/arcutis-launches-new-clearing-seb-derm-educational-campaign-ahead-expected-fda-decision) to raise awareness of seb derm ahead of the Zoryve foam approval. The “Clearing Up Seb Derm” effort was created to help connect people with educational and support resources and encourage them to seek professional treatment if necessary.

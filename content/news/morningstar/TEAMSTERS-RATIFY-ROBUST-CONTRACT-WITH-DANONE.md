"Our members deserve a great contract that reflects the sacrifice and commitment they provide to making Danone successful, and that is exactly what we accomplished," said Michael Moxley, President of Teamsters Local 29. "This contract provides our members with better pay and a secure retirement."

The new agreement guarantees wage increases, additional paid sick time and vacation time, maintenance of medical benefits, entrance into the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Fund, and a simplified grievance procedure.

"We fought for what we deserve and we got it," said Allen Robertson, a mechanic at Danone. "We are very happy with our new agreement."

The deal struck in Virginia comes on the heels of an historic contract with Danone in Fort Worth, Texas. Teamsters Local 767 secured an agreement that includes pension contributions, major wage increases, reduced health care costs, and double time for members who work weekends.

"Danone Teamsters are on a winning streak and will continue to win respect and strengthen workplace protections," said Jesse Case, Director of the Teamsters Food Processing Division.

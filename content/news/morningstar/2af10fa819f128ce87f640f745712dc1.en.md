**Shareholder Alert: Ademi & Fruchter LLP investigates whether SolarWinds Corporation is obtaining a Fair Price for its Public Shareholders**

There is no cost or obligation to you.

In the transaction, SolarWinds stockholders will receive only $18.50 per share or approximately $4.4 billion. SolarWinds insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.

The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing transactions for SolarWinds by imposing a significant penalty if SolarWinds accepts a competing bid. We are investigating the conduct of SolarWindsâ€™ board of directors, and whether they are fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders.

We specialize in shareholder litigation involving buyouts, mergers, and individual shareholder rights. For more information, please feel free to call us. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

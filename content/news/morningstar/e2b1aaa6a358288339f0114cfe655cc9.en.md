SINGAPORE, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BYDFi officially listed the [**BERA/USDT spot trading pair**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MaTOASNs9D2dV1_SsZLLWbV1co7bBZg8ScWABVlRGXBcF4NeOYzGLGtc06eaAEfcIXWbHoSXV8lpC3FTvKymqNb7CLYzfUUTu2vVde5nYBmLRAr1RGwFC1GW9iAC5Qjf) and launched [**BERA/USDT perpetual contracts**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MaTOASNs9D2dV1_SsZLLWUalo8YLl8NL2tIrT8Po1EChD5_XYEa4pHxdbumRYr1ItzKZzKJYSGw-QJ7yI0t7OyC4mroO6XvzjkUjJ3gmGZo-UFFbOBVMXVeXsodgn9Nj) with up to 75x leverage. Users can now participate in the 8,100 USDT reward campaign - for more details, please visit the [BYDFi website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3El8wM272ygGWOpEyvtRSzpctL4YqKfcG57xf7CoBxTMvsbxcjl_ORREzwIy1ZpO1zpoofoSfuEw2nL37cfDzQ==) or refer to [the official announcements](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9mLRw141i7G1VZwmepQlfQydU4ukEbLrsJRQPyKAeTxzoyN9g1aOlQzalEIqeX6rSGvTIsfY5e9VsAjUwaC5xAeEnkWYkvXL2Bk-t5lEn1tSJ0gYJYLPfkEWvt4IQC-GAHV5hVqZxmK_2opdRuadR3mvz-dbrRibdbrhOeC3U1UTq0GwJlHmcD3StoM5ZDTpZIgDU5r0Tm8vrgOBX1ggvQ==).

**Berachain: The Innovative Blockchain Powering $BERA**

As the native token of the Berachain blockchain, [**$BERA**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gjZBJz6Slm-DhL-C5bElgDRDozq2Q_M6xNymS-ucPeUzX1y4VnR0p4HgS23iQIJMwUhFs2rmZ6ayeJ4CfmMwPRQ7Pmhd_GKzbWuP4JHDXWk=) derives its value not only from market demand but also from the strong foundational support of the Berachain ecosystem. Berachain is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK. It utilizes an innovative Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism, which differs from traditional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems. By linking validator rewards to application demand and liquidity contributions, PoL creates a dynamic incentive structure that prevents token devaluation and liquidity depletion. This groundbreaking economic model fosters mutual value creation between the blockchain and applications built on it, ensuring sustainable growth.

On April 20, 2023, Berachain successfully raised $42 million in a Series A funding round led by Polychain Capital. Furthermore, ahead of its mainnet launch, Berachain’s liquidity pre-deposit application, Boyco, attracted over $3 billion within one week, demonstrating strong market interest and adoption.

**$BERA: The Key Asset of Berachain**

$BERA, as the native token of Berachain, is primarily used to pay network transaction fees (gas) and can be staked to cover validator activation costs

**Market Performance:**

* Within just 24 hours of launch, $BERA’s market capitalization surged past $1.5 billion
* As of the time of writing, $BERA is priced at $7.9191
* 24-hour trading volume reached $2.187 billion, marking a 2,291.00% increase from the previous day

With the continuous expansion of the Berachain ecosystem, the demand for $BERA is expected to grow, driving its market value even higher.

**Illinois American Water Announces Launch of American Water Charitable Foundation’s 2025 Water and Environment Grant Program**

Illinois American Water is thrilled to announce the launch of the [American Water Charitable Foundation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amwater.com%2Fawcf&esheet=54201745&newsitemid=20250207289258&lan=en-US&anchor=American+Water+Charitable+Foundation&index=1&md5=9f1666b070a471a5e5e54ed12506a568) 2025 Water and Environment Grant Program. The Foundation invites community partners to apply for grants that promote clean water, conservation, environmental education, climate variability and water-based recreation projects.

“Thanks to this grant, we were able to enhance the Red Oak Rain Garden by replacing plants lost to drought and fund signage that amplifies our clean water message,” said Eliana Brown, University of Illinois Extension water quality and stormwater specialist. “Illinois American Water staff even joined us on-site helping us on planting day! American Water has been wonderful to work with and we’re deeply grateful.”

In 2024, the American Water Charitable Foundation awarded a combined total of $1 million to 59 organizations in 11 states, supporting organizations located in communities served by American Water, including 7 from Illinois-based organizations: Ducks Unlimited, Foundation for Ohio River Education, Lewis and Clark Community College Foundation, Nature at the Confluence, Peoria Park District, Streator Township High School Foundation and University of Illinois.

“Our commitment to providing clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater service to our customers and communities includes helping to protect our water sources,” said Rebecca Losli, President of Illinois American Water. “Collaborating with the Foundation and community partners through this grant program strengthens our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and bolsters our support for watershed conservation efforts.”

The Foundation supports three pillars of giving: Water, People and Communities. Since 2012, the American Water Charitable Foundation has invested over $20 million in funding through grants and matching gifts that positively benefit the communities where American Water and its employees live and work.

“The American Water Charitable Foundation is proud to work collaboratively with Illinois American Water and launch the 2025 Water and Environment Grant Program, supporting impactful initiatives and programs across the nation,” said Carrie Williams, President of the American Water Charitable Foundation. “Our charitable focus to Keep Communities Flowing empowers Our mission to Keep Communities Flowing empowers communities to understand the importance of water education and conservation, while also encouraging local organizations to engage in protecting this vital resource.”

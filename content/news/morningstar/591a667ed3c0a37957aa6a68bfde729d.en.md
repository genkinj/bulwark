Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that IAS was experiencing a new material trend of increased competitive pricing pressures and that, as a result, IAS had been forced to cut prices to compensate for weakening demand and slowing revenue growth; (2) that IAS’s pricing function was no longer “favorable” and IAS could not sustain its pricing and drive price increases; (3) that pricing had become a key differentiator between IAS and its competitor necessary to close major renewals and new deals; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

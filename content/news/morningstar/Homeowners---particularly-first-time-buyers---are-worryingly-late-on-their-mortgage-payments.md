Rising mortgage delinquencies among homeowners could be the 'canary in the coal mine,' expert says

A rising number of homeowners, particularly first-time home buyers and military members and veterans, are missing their monthly payments - and one group says it could be the "canary in the coal mine."

In 2024, the share of serious delinquencies - which refers to mortgage loans that are over 90 days past due but are not in active foreclosure - rose to the highest level in nearly two years, according to a monthly report by Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE (ICE).

Delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration loans, typically used by first-time home buyers, rose 74 basis points in 2024. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Delinquencies on FHA loans were also 2.5 percentage points higher than where they were prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Delinquencies on Veterans Affairs loans, typically used by home buyers who are military service members or veterans, rose 80 basis points in 2024.

Overall, about 2.2 million mortgages were either delinquent or in active foreclosure as of the end of 2024, ICE said.

The FHA and VA delinquencies are "likely to serve as canaries in the coal mine for mortgage performance in this cycle," the company noted in its report.

To be sure, the national delinquency rate is still lower than before the pandemic. The national delinquency rate rose 14 basis points in 2024, but was still 22 basis points below where it was prior to the pandemic.

Homeowners with conventional mortgages doing fine

But other industry data sources also reflect rising distress levels among certain homeowners.

Over the span of a year, the seriously delinquent rate among all types of loans rose 16 basis points as of the third quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, an industry trade group.

The rates of seriously delinquent FHA and VA loans, on the other hand, were rising much more quickly. The seriously delinquent rate on FHA loans rose 70 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period a year ago. The rate on VA loans saw a 57-basis-point increase, the MBA said.

In contrast, the seriously delinquent rate for conventional loans rose 2 basis points over the span of one year.

The ICE data also showed relative strength among homeowners with conventional mortgages, or those who have bank-owned mortgages. The share of them that fell behind on their mortgage payments decreased in 2024 compared to the year before.

Why some homeowners are missing their mortgage payments

Why are delinquency rates rising among first-time and military buyers?

There were a number of factors, one expert said. "Some of today's headwinds include inflationary pressures, lower personal savings rates, natural disasters, increasing consumer debt, higher tax and insurance payments, and higher debt-to-income ratios," Marina Walsh, vice president of industry analysis at the MBA, said in a statement.

Household debt, for one, hit a new record high in 2024, according to a New York Fed report released in the third quarter.

"All of these factors may be impacting government borrowers to a greater extent than conventional borrowers," she added.

One possible reason behind the uptick in FHA delinquencies is that borrowers who use FHA loans are typically financially weaker than those who apply for conventional loans. FHA loans are usually easier to qualify for than conventional loans. For instance, they require a lower minimum credit score, and ask for a down payment of 3.5% of a home's sale price.

Andy Walden, ICE's head of mortgage and housing-market research, said less well-resourced borrowers have flocked to FHA and VA loans partly because not many private lenders cater to these borrowers.

"In recent years, without a meaningful private-label market at the lower end of the economic spectrum, borrowers in that category have turned to FHA and VA products," Walden said. "As economic pressures increase, that's where you will tend to see the market turn first."

Who's missing payments on their mortgages?

The states with the highest quarterly increases in delinquency rates were concentrated in the South, according to MBA data. The five states were Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana.

The impact of January's Southern California wildfires on homeowners' ability to repay their mortgages is not yet fully reflected in the reports.

More than six in 10 mortgages affected by the Los Angeles fires are held by private lenders and were so-called portfolio loans, according to ICE. Such loans are not sold onto the secondary market by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises that oversee the bulk of all residential mortgages in the U.S.

In the Pacific Palisades, where the average single-family residence is valued at $3.6 million according to ICE, 80% of mortgages on affected properties are portfolio loans, ICE noted. FHA and VA loans comprised a "minimal" share of loans in the Pacific Palisades.

But homeowners are not about to lose their homes to foreclosure

Even though some homeowners missed their mortgage payments, foreclosures remain low for now.

Foreclosures remain relatively "muted" due to the availability of forbearance programs that let homeowners pause payments under certain circumstances, as well as other programs designed by the government to help prevent people from losing their homes, ICE said.

Homeowners also are benefiting from big gains in home equity. The share of homes with an outstanding mortgage that were considered to be "equity-rich" in the fourth quarter of 2024 was about 48%, which was far above the 27% recorded in early 2020, according to a separate report by Attom, a property-data company.

The average owner had $319,000 of equity in their home, of which $207,000 can be borrowed against the property while maintaining a 20% equity cushion, as of the third quarter of 2024, ICE said previously.

Homeowners can draw on that equity to help pay off other debts.

The investigation concerns whether Alumis and its board violated the federal securities laws and/or breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to, among other things: (1) obtain the best possible consideration for Alumis shareholders; and (2) disclose all material information necessary for Alumis shareholders to adequately assess and value the merger consideration.

On behalf of Alumis shareholders, Halper Sadeh LLC may seek increased consideration for shareholders, additional disclosures and information concerning the proposed transaction, or other relief and benefits. **We would handle the action on a contingent fee basis, whereby you would not be responsible for out-of-pocket payment of our legal fees or expenses.**

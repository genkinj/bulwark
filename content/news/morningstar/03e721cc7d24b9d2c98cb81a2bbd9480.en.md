SkyDrive is developing a lightweight, three-seater eVTOL aircraft that will play a key future role in the coming urban transport revolution. As eVTOL flights become a regular part of city life, SkyDrive seeks to lead this market transformation.

JR East is dedicated to crafting travel experiences that highlight the diverse appeal of local regions, including nature, cuisine, industry, and tradition. In line with this vision, JR East launched a new hotel brand called "AZUMA FARM" in January 2025. The first hotel under this brand, "AZUMA FARM KOIWAI," will open in spring 2026 at Koiwai Farm in Iwate Prefecture.

SkyDrive is collaborating with JR East to explore the possibility of offering air taxi experiences as a valuable enhancement for guests at "AZUMA FARM KOIWAI." Both companies are currently considering plans for an eVTOL route connecting Morioka city, a key access point to Koiwai Farm, to the hotel as well as tourism flights. This innovative transportation option would enable guests to enjoy stunning views of Mount Iwate and the beautiful surrounding landscapes while traveling in privacy and comfort, making travel time a truly memorable experience. SkyDrive and JR East will continue to collaborate closely and deepen discussions of essential factors such as landing and takeoff locations, flight routes, and ticket pricing.

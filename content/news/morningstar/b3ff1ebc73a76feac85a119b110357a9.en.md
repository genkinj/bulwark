Market News Alerts Updates: DarioHealth Corp. (Nasdaq: DRIO)\* has [announced](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fdariohealth-announces-blue-cross-blue-133000962.html&esheet=54201032&newsitemid=20250206193804&lan=en-US&anchor=announced&index=1&md5=edabebeafb5f72352cb722234f8ef705) a significant new agreement with a Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) health plan, marking a pivotal expansion in the fast-growing digital health landscape. This move integrates Dario's AI-driven cardiometabolic digital health solutions, covering diabetes, hypertension, and weight management, into the offerings of one of America’s most trusted health insurers. According to a recent [report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstraitsresearch.com%2Freport%2Fcardiometabolic-disease-market&esheet=54201032&newsitemid=20250206193804&lan=en-US&anchor=report&index=2&md5=b9ab57509e49d7de25006fc3f86d5451), the cardiometabolic disease market is projected to surpass $1.2 trillion by 2033.

According to the company, the BCBS partnership, launched in January 2025, is already contributing to Dario's recurring revenue growth and is expected to expand throughout the year. This adds to Dario's impressive roster of nine health plan clients, including national and regional payers, and 12 Fortune 500 companies, according to the company.

Financial momentum seemingly remains strong, with Q3 2024 revenue up 111% YoY, driven by operational efficiencies post-Twill acquisition. A $25.6 million private placement has boosted Dario's cash position to $40.6 million, supporting growth strategies. The company targets operational cash flow positivity by mid-2025.

Recently, the company also reported another potential key growth driver -- Dario's expansion into the booming $100 billion GLP-1 weight-loss market. Notably, unlike competitors, Dario offers an end-to-end solution that integrates GLP-1 prescriptions with behavioral health tools, enhancing long-term outcomes. Strategic collaborations, such as with MediOrbis, further strengthen this offering.

Dario’s data-driven approach delivers measurable results: 5x ROI for payers, a 58% reduction in hyperglycemic events, and a 59% decrease in anxiety symptoms. Its scalable, AI-powered platform is rapidly gaining traction among payers and employers seeking cost-effective, high-impact health solutions.

With a presence in multi-billion-dollar markets, expanding health plan partnerships, strong financials, and cutting-edge technology, DarioHealth is positioning itself as a potential digital health powerhouse in the making.

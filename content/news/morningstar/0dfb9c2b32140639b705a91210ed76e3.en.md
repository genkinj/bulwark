**Highlights of the 2025 Outdoor Collection**

Gracing the cover of the new Sourcebook, designer **Mathias de Ferm** (Belgium) introduces [***Striata***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat31840062%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat31840062&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Striata&index=2&md5=47bf9e13b8a962af55578fb600932575)in his first collaboration with RH. Defined by its sculptural barrelback silhouette, the collection is meticulously wrapped in handwoven all-weather rope, showcasing refined reeded detailing. A slender opening at the back allows for a whisper of light to stream through, offering a dynamic interplay of light and shadow.

In a new partnership with furniture maker **Arthur Gentil** (Milan), [***Sedona***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat31840124%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat31840124&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Sedona&index=3&md5=c5502fb73b98483963be6e11dd7f1517) embraces the bold geometric forms of modern architecture, showcasing an elegant juxtaposition of solid and open space. A recessed base allows the ultra-thick, tailored cushions to appear as if floating while maintaining a strong, grounded presence. Also debuting is [***Sedona Cane***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat31840093%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat31840093&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Sedona+Cane&index=4&md5=90c2f69febfcc6dffb7336be7f9aa357), distinguished by textural panels of handwoven all-weather cane.

Minimalist form meets natural beauty in [***Dune***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat32030199%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat32030199&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Dune&index=5&md5=1cc3e8b57c7911f6328d1f499b7eb846)***,*** designed by **Harrison and Nicholas Condos** (Sydney), with soft curves inspired by coastal sand dunes meeting the shoreline. Displaying distinctly wide arms that wrap around an ultra-comfortable quick-dry seat cushion, the collection invites relaxation and conversation.

The design duo also introduces [***Kavala***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat32030230%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat32030230&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Kavala&index=6&md5=f8f9270e1ae51a0bf54ec79602df9bac)***,***melding the simplicity of Scandinavian furnishings with the Japanese reverence for balance and natural materials, where refined curves and expert upholstery seamlessly merge indoor elegance with outdoor durability.

Internationally acclaimed designer **Mario Ruiz** (Spain) blends art deco inspiration with the refined language of Scandinavian design in [***Lagos***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat31840031%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat31840031&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Lagos&index=7&md5=1c535a11fcf5ca8aa0e5121b65b120b7)***,***combining clean-lined simplicity with soft curves and highlighting a dedication to superior craftsmanship.

Designer **Ann Marie Vering** (Los Angeles) draws inspiration from the graceful lines of a calla lily to create [***Bloom***](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frh.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fcategory%2Fproducts.jsp%3FcategoryId%3Dcat31840129%26pgterm%3Dcategory%253Acat31840129&esheet=54201396&newsitemid=20250207653920&lan=en-US&anchor=Bloom&index=8&md5=ace32f980a682442fe814dba94f75b48)***,*** featuring a sculptural profile, balanced proportions and eloquent curves.

Complementing this season’s offerings is a collection of enduring fire tables.

--Online fast-fashion giant Shein is poised to reduce its valuation in a potential initial public offering in London to around $50 billion, nearly a quarter less than the company's 2023 fundraising value, Reuters reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

--The eventual IPO valuation will depend on the impact of the end of the 'de minimis' rule on the retailer's business, after President Trump said he would terminate the duty exemption on imports worth $800 or less in the U.S., according to one of Reuters' unnamed sources.

--The import rule had helped Shein keep prices low, as it allowed it to avoid import duties on low-value packages from China, Reuters reports.

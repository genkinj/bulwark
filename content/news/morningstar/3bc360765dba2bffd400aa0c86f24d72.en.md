*Minneapolis-based Kristin Larson is the latest wirehouse advisor to choose* *Sanctuary's Partnered Independence model*

INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanctuary Wealth (Sanctuary), providing elite financial advisors the freedom, flexibility, control and choice to thrive in an evolving industry, welcomes NewSpring Wealth Partners to its growing network. Founded by wealth advisor **Kristin Larson, CFP®, CPWA®**, the Minneapolis-based firm manages nearly $200 million in total client assets. Before establishing her independent practice with Sanctuary, Larson spent the past nine years serving clients at UBS.

"We were pleased to invite Kristin to join Sanctuary's Partnered Independence model and are excited to help her launch NewSpring," said **Vince Fertitta, President of Sanctuary Wealth**. "Her accomplishments so early in her career are admirable – already being recognized as one of the top next-gen and top woman advisors in the industry. By choosing independence, she has unlocked a valuable asset with a fantastic growth trajectory and can now serve as a true fiduciary for her clients, offering them expanded support, enhanced technology and objective investment solutions. Kristin's client-focused approach and core values align perfectly with Sanctuary's, and we look forward to helping her continue making her mark in the business."

NewSpring Wealth Partners is an independent advisory firm committed to partnering with clients to grow their wealth and achieve the financial confidence they need to make the most out of life. Looking to simplify finances and protect wealth, Larson created her firm to provide an open, non-judgmental, safe and confidential space where clients can share aspirations, reduce financial stress, and make smart decisions to achieve their goals.

"Once I got a glimpse of what is possible in the independent space, I couldn't unsee how much better I would be able to serve and communicate with clients than continuing to work as an employee," said Larson. "With Sanctuary, I've found a true partner who will support my practice, helping me empower mid-career professionals, especially women, who, like me, are starting on new journeys. Access to best-in-class technology, solutions and coaching coupled with the freedom and flexibility to grow my brand as I see fit, made Sanctuary the perfect place to launch NewSpring."

Larson has over a decade of experience in the wealth management industry and takes a highly personal approach, serving as a trusted financial advisor and advocate for clients. She is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® and Certified Private Wealth Advisor®. Before founding NewSpring, Larson most recently served as Senior Vice President, Wealth Management and Financial Advisor with the Carlson Larson Wealth Management group at UBS Financial Services, Inc. Prior to UBS, she served in various planning and client service roles at Wells Fargo Advisors and Ameriprise. Larson is a two-time Forbes Top Next-Gen Wealth Advisors (Best-in-State, 2023, 2024) and a Forbes Top Women Wealth Advisors (Best-in-State, 2024).\*

"It's my pleasure to welcome Kristin and NewSpring Wealth Partners to the Sanctuary family," added **Adam Malamed, CEO of Sanctuary Wealth**. "As the great wealth transfer continues, women will gain even greater control over the nation's finances and many will look to accomplished women like Kristin to manage their assets and achieve their financial goals. I'm proud that Sanctuary has the platform and culture that continues to attract such high-quality, women-led partner firms, and we stand committed to ensuring Kristin has all she needs to succeed in the independent space."

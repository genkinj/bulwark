**Shareholder Alert: Ademi & Fruchter LLP investigates whether Altus Power, Inc. is obtaining a Fair Price for its Public Shareholders**

There is no cost or obligation to you.

In the transaction, Altus Power stockholders will receive only $5.00 per share of its Class A common stock in an all-cash transaction that values the Company at approximately $2.2 billion, including outstanding debt. Altus Power insiders will receive substantial benefits as part of change of control arrangements.

The transaction agreement unreasonably limits competing transactions for Altus Power by imposing a significant penalty if Altus Power accepts a competing bid. We are investigating the conduct of Altus Powerâ€™s board of directors, and whether they are fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders.

We specialize in shareholder litigation involving buyouts, mergers, and individual shareholder rights. For more information, please feel free to call us. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

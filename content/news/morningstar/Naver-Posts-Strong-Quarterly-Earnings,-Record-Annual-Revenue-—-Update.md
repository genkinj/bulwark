South Korean internet giant Naver posted stronger-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter and record annual revenue, driven by robust growth at its core search-platform and e-commerce businesses.

The upbeat results came as the company continued its artificial-intelligence push after developing HyperCLOVA X, an advanced version of its large language model, to help improve its platform services and online business transactions.

Net profit for the October-December period jumped 49% from a year earlier to 444.10 billion won, equivalent to $307.1 million, the company said Friday. That beat a FactSet-compiled consensus estimate of 414.49 billion won.

Revenue rose 14% to 2.886 trillion won for the quarter, and operating profit increased 34% to 542.00 billion won.

The company's key search-platform advertising business posted 15% revenue growth in the final quarter of 2024, accelerating from the previous quarter's 11% rise. Revenue from its e-commerce business climbed 17%, also picking up from the prior quarter's 12% gain.

For the full year, net profit jumped 89% to 1.862 trillion won. Revenue increased 11% to a record 10.738 trillion won in 2024, with operating profit up 33% at a record 1.979 trillion won.

Naver said it was the first South Korean internet-platform company to top 10 trillion won in annual revenue.

In an earnings call Friday, Chief Executive Choi Soo-yeon said she will step up efforts to advance the company's platform based on AI technology and implement the "on service" AI strategy across Naver services to create new value and more business opportunities.

Choi was also upbeat about Naver's recent launch of a separate "Plus Store" online shopping app that offers personalized services. She said the initial user feedback has been positive, which should help boost its e-commerce business. Naver's gross merchandise value is expected to return to double-digit growth in 2025, Choi said.

Shares in Naver were recently 1.7% lower on Friday, reversing early gains after the earnings report.

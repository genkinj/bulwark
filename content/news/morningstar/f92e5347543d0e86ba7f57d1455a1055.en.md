The Allegations: Rosen Law Firm is Investigating the Allegations that Cassava Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAVA) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Operations.

According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Cassava’s drug prospects and anticipated growth while also minimizing risk from a potential drug failure. Yet, in truth, Cassava’s repeated statements of confidence in simufilam, Cassava’s leading drug candidate, and reliance upon spinning the statistically insignificant data from the Phase 2 study fell short of the reality of simufilam’s potential; Cassava simply did not have a drug that was capable of abating the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease, even when attempting to treat only the mild and moderate cases. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

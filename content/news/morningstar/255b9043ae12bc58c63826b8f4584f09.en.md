WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 7, 2025


WEST SACRAMENTO, Calif., Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sierra Northern Railway (SNR), a division of Sierra Railroad Company, has announced its acquisition of the assets of RailPower LLC, a groundbreaking step toward revolutionizing rail transportation with clean energy solutions. SNR, already a leader in hydrogen-fueled locomotive technology and the owner of the largest RailPower locomotive fleet in America, is poised to integrate RailPower's hybrid innovations with its hydrogen expertise.

RailPower has a strong legacy, having produced approximately 190 locomotives, including 55 GG20B hybrid switchers, 116 RP20BD genset locomotives, and other models like the GG10B, GK10B, RP14BD, and RP20SD. These locomotives are recognized for their fuel efficiency and low emissions, serving industrial switching, short-line railroads, and port operations across North America.

SNR plans to build its hydrogen locomotives on RailPower's proven platform, initially targeting the 260 locomotives used by shortline railroads in California. This initiative combines the strengths of both companies to offer cutting-edge, zero-emission rail solutions tailored to industry needs.

The development of SNR's first hydrogen locomotives was made possible through key partnerships with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and the California State Transportation Agency (CalSTA). With significant funding and support from these organizations, SNR successfully designed and built its hydrogen locomotive prototypes, demonstrating the feasibility of renewable hydrogen as a clean fuel source for rail operations.

This acquisition underscores Sierra Railroad Company's commitment to advancing sustainable transportation technologies while supporting California's ambitious climate goals. By merging RailPower's hybrid expertise with Sierra Northern Railway's hydrogen technology, the company aims to lead the rail industry into a new era of clean, efficient, and innovative rail transport.

**Sierra Northern Railway (SERA):** Sierra Northern Railway is the freight division of privately owned, Sierra Railroad Company. Sierra Railroad Company is also the principal owner of Sierra Energy Corporation, which has developed a proprietary waste- to- clean hydrogen technology: FastOx® gasification. Sierra Northern Railway currently operates approximately 75 miles of track in Northern California and 30 miles in Southern California through the heart of a number of the Golden State's prime industrial areas, serving a wide variety of customers, and interchanging with both BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad.

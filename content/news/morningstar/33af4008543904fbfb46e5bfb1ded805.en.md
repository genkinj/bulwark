**Canadian Space Agency Assigns Can$72 Million Contract to Spire Global Canada to Design WildFireSat Mission**

*Spire has agreed to develop a satellite constellation to monitor all active wildfires in Canada from space*

*OroraTech has agreed to develop the payloads for the satellite constellation*

Spire Global Canada, a subsidiary of [Spire Global, Inc.](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fspire.com%2F&esheet=54201391&newsitemid=20250207443592&lan=en-US&anchor=Spire+Global%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=db91800b111efba0614a11a1bd41cc61) (NYSE: SPIR) (“Spire” or “the Company”), was assigned a Can$72 million contract, including harmonized sales tax, by the Government of Canada. Spire will design and develop a dedicated satellite constellation to monitor all active wildfires in Canada from space as part of Canada’s WildFireSat mission. The Company has agreed to partner with OroraTech, a leader in space-based thermal intelligence, to develop the payloads for the satellite constellation.

Canada spends roughly Can$1 billion every year fighting wildfires, with indirect costs much higher due to property damage, evacuations, health expenses and economic losses in sectors like forestry, energy and tourism. Furthermore, these wildfires disproportionately affect Indigenous communities in remote areas, making up an estimated 42% of wildfire-related evacuations despite being 5% of Canada’s population. This solution aims to save life, land and property by detecting wildfires.

"Detecting wildfires is one of the most impactful satellite capabilities, offering significant benefits for public safety, environmental health and the economy,” said Theresa Condor, CEO of Spire Global. “We’re proud to work with the Government of Canada, which is paving the way in developing a next-generation wildfire monitoring system to protect its citizens and communities."

Spire has agreed to design and develop the dedicated satellite constellation. OroraTech has agreed to develop the wildfire detection payloads that will be deployed on the satellites, as well as build the data handling and processing system. These payloads have already provided data during Canadian wildfire emergencies, with OroraTech providing detection and management services to Quebec’s wildfire authority, Société de protection des forêts contre le feu (SOPFEU).

To deliver on this contract, Spire intends to expand its existing Canadian office in Cambridge, Ontario to add satellite manufacturing and test equipment, enabling WildFireSat and future missions to be manufactured domestically in Canada.

“Spire and OroraTech are pleased to support the Government of Canada with our proven infrared camera technology and data processing architecture, providing exceptional imagers for wildfire detection, management and response,” said Martin Langer, CEO & CTO of OroraTech. “We are particularly proud that this will help Indigenous communities across Canada to respond effectively to these natural threats, safeguarding their communities and way of life.”

Spire and OroraTech have partnered with the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation’s Wakâ Mne – Science and Culture Initiative to enable the participation of Indigenous businesses in the WildFireSat mission, driving direct economic benefits and employment opportunities.

The WildFireSat mission is a joint initiative by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Natural Resources Canada’s Canadian Forest Service (CFS), Canadian Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation (CCMEO) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). This mission aims to deliver data on wildfire behaviour, smoke and air quality, targeting a significant gap in current satellite coverage. By focusing on the late afternoon "peak burn period" when wildfires are most intense, WildFireSat aims to enhance decision-making for wildfire response, reduce losses and protect communities.

The WildFireSat constellation is planned for launch in 2029 and will be operated by the CSA for a minimum of five years.

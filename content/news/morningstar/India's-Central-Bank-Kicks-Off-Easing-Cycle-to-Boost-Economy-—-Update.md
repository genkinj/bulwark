India's central bank has kicked off its easing cycle, cutting its policy rate for the first time in nearly five years as economic growth slows and inflation cools.

In his first policy statement at the Reserve Bank of India's helm, Gov. Sanjay Malhotra said Friday that the monetary-policy committee voted unanimously to cut the policy repo rate to 6.25% from 6.50%.

All 12 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the decision, which marks the end of the RBI's status as one of the few central banks in the region that had yet to start easing.

The committee also unanimously decided to keep a neutral policy stance so as to have the flexibility to respond to macroeconomic developments.

The RBI remains "unambiguously focused" on aligning inflation with its target while also supporting growth, Malhotra said.

He acknowledged recent concerns about rupee depreciation, and said the central bank would stick to its policy of intervening to smooth out excessive volatility

Markets will likely be reassured by the overall tone of the governor's first press conference, with his message seeming to be that he is a steady pair of hands, said Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research Asia ex-Japan at Mizuho Securities.

India's Sensex was little changed after RBI's decision, while the rupee was also little moved, last trading at 87.47 to the dollar versus 87.43 shortly prior to the decision.

Economists had seen a strong case for a cut after advance data for the financial year ending March signaled that India's economy slowed to a four-year low. The latest budget added to those expectations, as the lack of a major fiscal impulse suggests monetary policy will need to do more of the heavy lifting to rekindle economic momentum.

Inflation has also been trending lower over the past year, but concerns about potential price shocks in an increasingly volatile external environment remain.

The RBI alluded to those risks on Friday, noting headwinds from volatility in global financial markets, geopolitical tensions and protectionist trade policies.

"This calls for the MPC to remain watchful," it said.

That said, the central bank gave a relatively upbeat view on India's economic prospects, expecting inflation to stay moderate and growth to improve.

Real gross domestic product growth for the next fiscal year is projected at 6.7%, up from an estimated 6.4% for this year, and inflation is expected to ease to 4.2% from 4.8%, Malhotra said.

Household consumption is expected to remain robust, aided by income tax relief announced in the budget last week, while services exports will continue to support economic growth, he added.

With the RBI offering little in the way of forward guidance, economists are left wondering how deep the easing cycle could be.

Economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics sees further easing on the cards, as growth is likely to remain soft in the coming quarters. Apurva Sheth, head of market perspectives & research at Samco Securities, sees limited scope for cuts, with much depending on how the Federal Reserve moves amid caution on the potential inflationary impact of President Trump's economic policies.

The RBI's decision comes as markets watch to see what policymakers will do to navigate an increasingly complex trade environment. There were some tensions between India and the U.S. during the first Trump presidency and with growth at home slowing, analysts expect New Delhi will be keen to avoid frictions the second time around.

During a call in January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump spoke about expanding and deepening cooperation, according to a readout published by the White House. Trump stressed the importance of India increasing its procurement of U.S. security equipment and moving toward "a fair bilateral trading relationship," the readout showed.

"Modi's first task is to avoid being dragged into the trade war," Gavekal Research analysts said in a report.

Noting that nearly a fifth of India's exports go to the U.S., they think Modi will want to show Trump that he is serious about addressing the trade surplus, which grew to $37 billion in the 12 months to November 2024. A deal to buy U.S. military equipment or take back immigrants could be on the cards, analysts Tom Miller and Udith Sikand said.

"If these efforts to placate Trump succeed, Indian policymakers can concentrate on the domestic economy," they said.

India's latest budget showed a focus on reviving consumption and pivoting away from infrastructure spending-led growth. Trade-friendly measures including import tariff cuts are also seen as positioning for the shifting trade climate.

India, on paper, looks less vulnerable to trade risks than other Asian economies thanks in part to its supply chain linkages, but its challenges don't begin and end with Trump, Mizuho Securities' Varathan said.

"With external demand uncertain and public sector largesse exhausted, any improvement in India's growth outlook now depends on the domestic private sector," the Gavekal analysts said. "But keeping Trump sweet can only help."

HOUSTON, Feb. 7, 2025


***Building Permits Play a Vital Role in Transforming Cities for the Biggest Sporting Event of the Year***

HOUSTON, Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As the countdown to **Super Bowl 59** moves forward, behind the scenes, a crucial yet often overlooked process is ensuring the city is ready to welcome **hundreds of thousands of football fans and global visitors**—**building permitting**. From **high-tech fan experiences** to **NFL hospitality zones and restaurant expansions**, permits serve as the foundation for transforming New Orleans into the ultimate destination for **raving NFL fans and economic growth**.

With deep expertise in major sporting event permitting—including securing critical permits for **Super Bowl 51 in Houston**—**PermitUsNow**, an industry recognized building permitting firm, is shining a spotlight on how permitting is shaping **Super Bowl 59's entertainment and infrastructure**.

**Permitting: The MVP of Super Bowl 59's Fan Experience**

While fans have been gearing up all week for **game day excitement**, permit expediters have been working for months—sometimes years—to ensure key elements of the **Super Bowl entertainment experience** are fully approved, compliant, and ready to operate.

**Super Bowl VIP suite remodels, NFL-sponsored fan zones, and massive pop-up venues** require extensive planning and approvals, from **electrical and structural permits** to **safety and compliance reviews**. PermitUsNow played a pivotal role in **Super Bowl 51** by securing permits for:

* Multiple **15-ft Super Bowl countdown clocks** strategically placed across Houston—installed a year in advance to build excitement.
* **NFL Experience and Fox News NFL Zone at Discovery Green**, requiring complex **fiber, electrical, and staging permits**.
* **Eight new restaurants** at and near the **George R. Brown Convention Center**, including **Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, The Rustic, Bud's Pitmaster BBQ, and McAlister's Deli**—permitted within 30 days and launched in time for the Super Bowl rush.

These permitting efforts helped Houston **accommodate record-breaking crowds, boost the local economy, and create unforgettable moments for fans**.

**Super Bowl 59: A Boon for New Orleans' Economy**

Historically, **host cities experience a surge in tourism, job creation, and local business growth** leading up to the Super Bowl. According to reports, **Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas generated over $600 million in economic impact**, and New Orleans is most likely on track to meet its economic target.

*"Every Super Bowl host city wants to deliver a first-class experience for fans while maximizing economic benefits. Permitting is what allows these large-scale activations to happen—without it, timelines get delayed, venues don't open, and cities miss out on revenue,"* said Helen Callier, Founder and CEO of PermitUsNow.

With extensive experience in **fast-tracking Super Bowl-related permits**, **PermitUsNow** is ready to assist cities, developers, and businesses in making **future Super Bowls, World Cups and FIFA's even bigger and better**. From securing **permits for fan engagement structures and media zones** to **expediting approvals for hospitality and entertainment venues**, PermitUsNow ensures that projects stay **on time and are fully permitted**.

**Ready to Get in the Game?**

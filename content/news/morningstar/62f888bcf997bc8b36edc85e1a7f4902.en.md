"These LED tiles really bring an audio-visual experience to life," explained a spokesperson for GSE AV. "You can build them into different shapes that suit the needs of a variety of exhibition scenarios."

GSE AV has curved and flat tiles from Recience; they can even be set up as cubes or oblong-shaped installations. The entire system seamlessly integrates into [Recience](https://pr.report/6xh4), [BeMatrix](https://pr.report/6xh5) or [Aluvision](https://pr.report/6xh6) frame systems. The 1.5 mm LED Tiles are durable and engineered for use in the professional AV business, which invariably involves frequent shipping, assembly, and reassembly. Uses include trade show booths, along with any video experience where the audience may be moving around a set of screens, rather than sitting in front of a fixed two-dimensional presentation.

Features include:

* Almost double the resolution of the previous 2.5mm tiles
* Clear display of small LED wall content
* AV designers can now create seamless corners.
* 496mm x 496mm tile frames are compatible with Aluvision, BeMatrix, and custom booth systems.
* F-track channeling for SEG graphics
* Can be used as flooring to create amazing effects

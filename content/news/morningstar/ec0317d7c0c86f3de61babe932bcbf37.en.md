*Sensori.Ai reveals the answers applying neuroscience and GenAI to match Brands with Athletes, Celebrities, and Influencers.* 

NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Billions of dollars will be spent by them on marketing—but which brands would benefit the most from Mahomes, Hurts, and Kelce endorsements?

As Super Bowl LIX readies for kick-off, the *real* choices will be formed by consumers' nonconscious minds, where neuroscience teaches that 95% of daily decisions are made. Now, Sensori.Ai's neuroscience-powered GenAi algorithms have opened the window into the nonconscious, and delivered the answers.

[Sensori.Ai](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4357737-1&h=2123466461&u=http%3A%2F%2Fsensori.ai%2F&a=Sensori.Ai) deployed its highly advanced NeuroAi MasterMatchup™ technology to identify the ideal alignments between Super Bowl superstars and major brands. These alignments are based on how well brand purpose, function, and values resonate deep within the nonconscious with consumers' perceptions of Patrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts, and Travis Kelce.

"Consumers hold powerfully formed perceptions of high-profile professional athletes like these Super Bowl superstars, and they develop similarly strong affiliations with brands—both deep inside their nonconscious minds," said Dr. A. K. Pradeep, Chief Executive Officer of Sensori.Ai. "Conventional research methods cannot extract these nonconscious attitudes and outlooks accurately, but neuroscience principles, combined with the most advanced GenAi algorithms, can. That is what NeuroAi uniquely is, and what it does. For the first time, brand marketers can now know—with scientific certainty—where to invest their dollars for maximum impact and value."

Sensori.Ai analyzed category-leading consumer brands and assigned scores to each, broken out by sector and gender, reflecting how well-aligned they are with consumers' views of Mahomes, Hurts, and Kelce. There were notable differences by Category Sector and Gender categories.

**Athletic Wear Sector:**

For **Nike**, **Mahomes** took the lead among **Men** while for **Under Armour** and **Adidas,** it was **Hurts** who scored the touchdown.

However, the scores changed with **Women** – **Jalen Hurts** did best for all four brands – **Nike, Under Armour,** **Adidas**, and **Reebok**.

**Tech Sector:**

**Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn**, and **Microsoft** would benefit best from **Mahomes** among **Men,** while **Kelce** was the preferred choice among **Women** **for the same brands**.

**Google** however was a different story – **Kelce** scored best among **both** **men** **and women**.

**Tesla** matched the best with **Mahomes** among **Men**, while **Spotify** matched with **Kelce** among **Men**.

**Beverage Sector:**

The eternal battle between **Coca-Cola** and **Pepsi** was played as well – **Coca-Cola** matched well with **Kelce** among **both Men and Women**, while **Pepsi** aligned perfectly with **Mahomes** for **both Men and Women**.

**Gatorade** marched to its own tune matching with **Jalen Hurts** among **both Men and Women**.

**Starbucks** matched the best with **Kelce** among **Men,** while **Mahomes** took the lead with **Women**.

**High Fashion Sector:**

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, **Kelce** was the runway star **among both Men and Women for both Gucci and Chanel**.

"Our MasterMatchup™ technology can be applied to analyze and match any public personality or influencer, from star athletes to film, television, and music celebrities, to politicians, and more with brands," said Dr. Pradeep. "We are applying it to the world's major sports now, rolling it out globally. Going forward, this technology takes brand marketing, celebrity, and influencer marketing, to a much higher level of true measurability. CEOs and CMOs can now count on MasterMatchup™ to deliver direction and accountability for their decision-making."

By Ed Frankl

Industrial production in Germany sank lower in December last year, driven by a fall in output from the car industry, a further weak note for the troubled sector as it faces the threat U.S. of tariffs.

Output declined 2.4% on month in December, German statistics agency Destatis said Friday, worse than the 0.9% fall expected by economists in a poll compiled by The Wall Street Journal. Production fell 4.5% in 2024 as a whole.

The fall in December, more than offsetting the 1.3% growth in November, was driven by auto production, which contracted 10%. Energy-intensive production, which has struggled in recent years since the end of reliance on cheap Russian gas, declined 3.1% on month.

The industrial sector could face further slowdown from the effects of President Trump's proposed tariffs, given the U.S. is the top country for Germany's goods exports. Trump has said that the U.S. will "definitely" raise tariffs on goods from the European Union.

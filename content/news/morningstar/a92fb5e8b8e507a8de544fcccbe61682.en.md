* **Company's Scrap Metal Inventories are Estimated to Surpass $6 Million in Current Market Value, Ideally Positioned to Capitalize on Rising Metal Prices Amid Anticipated Tariff Increases**
* **Domestic Scrap Steel Prices Up Significantly This Week, Forecasted to Keep Climbing**
* **Exclusive Operational Licenses and Contracts with Suppliers Create Significant Barriers to Entry**

CHESAPEAKE, Va., Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Greenwave Technology Solutions, Inc.

$GWAV's inventories surpass $6 million in estimated value driven by surging metal prices and increasing demand.

**Strategic Inventory Accumulation Ahead of Tariff Hikes**

Since President Trump's election, Greenwave has been strategically **accumulating high-value steel, aluminum, and copper,** anticipating the **potential for higher tariffs** on imported metals. With domestic scrap steel prices surging **significantly this week** and expected to climb higher, the Company anticipates its revenue growth will continue to accelerate.

Greenwave's primary customers remit payment the same day as metal delivery, ensuring a steady cash flow. With a fleet of over 50 trucks, the Company can efficiently transport hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of metal to customers daily. **This operational agility allows Greenwave to capitalize on market opportunities, swiftly fulfill customer orders during supply chain disruptions, and maintain a robust liquidity position.**

**Rapid Consolidation of Scrap Industry Driving Scarcity**

Steelmakers are leading a wave of consolidation in the scrap metal industry, securing the supply of raw materials to de-risk their operations and feed a **projected increase of 16 million tons of annual capacity** in the coming years(1).

* **Sims Metal** acquired Baltimore Scrap Corp. for **$220 million** (2023) (2).
* **Nucor** acquired the assets of Garden Street Iron & Metal for an **undisclosed amount** (2023) (3).
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** acquired Ferrous Processing and Trading Co. for **$775 milli**on (2021) (4).
* **Steel Dynamics** acquired Roca Acero for **$90 million** (2022) (5).

**Clear Competitive Edge: Exclusive Licenses, Infrastructure, and Market Dominance**

Greenwave holds a portfolio of highly coveted operational licenses for the Company's metal recycling facilities. **These licenses, often protected by grandfathered municipal codes, provide significant barriers to entry to competitors in Greenwave's tightly regulated markets.**

*Key highlights include:*

* **Norfolk, VA Facility:** Positioned near the largest U.S. Naval Base, Greenwave's Norfolk facility benefits from a steady influx of prime scrap metal and holds one of the only Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles automotive recycler/demolisher licenses in the city.
* **Virginia Beach, VA Facility:** Greenwave operates the sole metal recycling facility in the state's largest city, Virginia Beach, strategically located near NAS Oceana and the region's thriving industrial core.
* **Portsmouth, VA Facility:** A cost-effective hub for domestic and international shipments due to its proximity to the Port of Virginia, the Company's Portsmouth facility holds a license protected by grandfathered regulations.

Greenwave recently completed a multi-year capex cycle in which it invested over $20 million in equipment, infrastructure, and a fleet of over 50 trucks to facilitate rapid expansion and delivery of significant quantities of mill-ready metal to industry titans. Further, the Company acquired the real estate for seven of its core facilities – thus **reducing the Company's annual rent expenses by approximately $1.7 million**, enhancing cashflow and **positioning the Company for potential high-value strategic transactions.**

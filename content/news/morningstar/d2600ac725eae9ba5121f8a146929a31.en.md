Shares of Nikola Corp. tumbled late Thursday after a report surfaced that the hydrogen-truck maker is close to filing bankruptcy.

Nikola (NKLA) is working with its law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman over a possible sale or restructuring, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Shares sank 32% to 51 cents in premarket trade.

In 2020, the once high-flying EV maker became the target of activist short-seller firm Hindenburg Research, which recently called it quits. The start-up was accused of misleading investors over the functionality of its vehicles. A year later, Nikola founder Trevor Milton was hit with federal fraud charges and later convicted.

MarketWatch has reached out to Nikola for comment.

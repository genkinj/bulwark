HONG KONG, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UCLOUDLINK GROUP INC. (“UCLOUDLINK” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: UCL), the world’s first and leading mobile data traffic sharing marketplace, announced that its *GlocalMe* UniCord solution has been awarded the “Best of CES 2025: Breakthrough Award” from [Android Authority](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sfWsRBVo2J4C-_emt_yoyRH9vm1NxTyvRr3Q8kpLvf-UR6EoD5A12cyKWkpK0ciXdJ-J7rblzrNt4yfpiWzSBetyG3UnTfpbPli1bxHD4hhXlXK3QQECQFocqHrbFq0Bv0iceOLtDLv4ffKAImJQ7A==).

The “Best of CES 2025: Breakthrough Award” recognizes smaller, up-and-coming brands poised to disrupt consumer technology. Part of UCLOUDLINK’s expanding *GlocalMe* Life series of products, UniCord emerged as a standout among tens of thousands of highly competitive entries for its built-in cloud-SIM solutions and multiply positioning systems. UniCord was spotlighted as a “must-have for frequent travelers” anytime and anywhere, eliminating the need for multiple chargers and SIM cards.

Mr. Chaohui Chen, Director and Chief Executive Officer of UCLOUDLINK, said, “We are very excited to see UniCord further solidify its market positioning as a pioneering travel essential with this award. This recognition underscores our commitment to redefine connectivity through user-centric innovation, offering travelers the convenience, flexibility, and more security to stay connected anytime and anywhere – whether for business or leisure. Such a strong endorsement will provide significant tailwinds for UniCord and our broader *GlocalMe* Life series for better connecting to the ideal network of life.”

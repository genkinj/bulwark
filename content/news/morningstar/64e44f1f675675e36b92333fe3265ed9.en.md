DeLauro had been serving as SEON's Chief Revenue Officer for the last two years and will continue to drive the company's go-to-market initiatives as it expands across regions and sectors. With nearly 20 years of SaaS leadership experience, DeLauro has held senior roles in strategy and development at organizations including NetSuite, Oracle and Extend.

Coelho, previously SEON's Senior Vice President of Marketing, has rapidly reshaped the company's marketing and demand generation strategies. With more than 20 years of senior marketing experience, she has held leadership roles at Quickbase, Mendix (acquired by Siemens), and Dell.

"Matt and Devlyn have been instrumental in driving SEON’s tremendous growth over the past year. Their vision and insight have been key to solidifying our standing as a global leader in fraud prevention," said Tamas Kadar, CEO, SEON. "As we expand into new markets and meet the growing demand for our fraud prevention and AML solutions, I’m excited to see their continued leadership guide us in our ambitious goals for this year and beyond."

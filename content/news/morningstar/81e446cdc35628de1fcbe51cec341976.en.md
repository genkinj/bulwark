In the Digital Entertainment segment, the HD (High-Definition) Game sub-segment’s net sales for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2024 declined compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year as new titles generated lower sales than releases such as “FINAL FANTASY XVI,” ”FINAL FANTASY PIXEL REMASTER,” and “Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince” had the previous year. However, sub-segment operating income increased mainly due to lower development cost amortization and advertising expenses compared with the same period of the previous year, as well as stronger sales of the November 2024 release “DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake” than initially assumed.

In the MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) Game sub-segment, net sales and operating income rose compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year on the launch of “FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail,” the latest expansion pack for “FINAL FANTASY XIV.”

In the Games for Smart Devices/PC Browser sub-segment, net sales and profits declined compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year despite the launch of “Emberstoria” in November 2024. This was due to weakness in existing titles, the recognition of royalty revenue in the previous fiscal year, and a valuation write-down associated with the content production account.

In the Amusement segment, saw net sales and operating income rise compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year on year-on-year growth in same-store sales and arcade game machine sales.

In the Publication segment, net sales and operating income declined compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year despite a generally solid performance. This was partly due to a year-on-year fallback in sales of “The Apothecary Diaries” following the massive popularity of the anime television series adaptation in the previous fiscal year, as well as to an increase in costs related to preparations for upcoming new releases.

In the Merchandising segment, saw net sales and operating income rise compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year, partly driven by brisk sales of new merchandise featuring key characters from the Group’s IP portfolio.

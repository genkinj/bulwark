OTTAWA--Unemployment in Canada unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in January as the recent pickup in the pace of hiring carried into the new year.

Statistics Canada reported Friday that Canada's economy added a net 76,000 jobs in January. Market expectations were for employment to increase by 25,000, after 90,900 jobs were added the month before, according to economists at TD Securities.

The unemployment rate was 0.1 percentage point lower at 6.6%, the lowest level since October. Expectations were for the jobless rate to tick up to 6.8%.

When calculated using U.S. Labor Department methodology, Canada's unemployment rate in January fell to 5.6% from 5.8% at the end of last year.

[The DJS Law Group](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdjslawllp.com%2F&esheet=54201742&newsitemid=20250207618307&lan=en-US&anchor=The+DJS+Law+Group&index=1&md5=67e727631c9b03623d0196e0e3ecbe86) announces that it is investigating claims on behalf of investors of e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (“e.l.f. Beauty” or “the Company”) (NYSE: [ELF](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketwatch.com%2Finvesting%2Fstock%2FELF&esheet=54201742&newsitemid=20250207618307&lan=en-US&anchor=ELF&index=2&md5=1ba580b1f6dee051bbe9ed35a0ca3a7a)) for violations of the securities laws.

**INVESTIGATION DETAILS:** The investigation focuses on whether the Company issued misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information pertinent to investors. Shares of e.l.f. Beauty fell sharply on February 7, 2025, after the company slashed its revenue outlook. According to *Business Insider,* “e.l.f. Beauty blamed its softer January sales for the reduced outlook. It stated that the beauty category experienced a slowdown partly due to lingering effects of holiday discounting and shifts in online posting behavior, influenced by concerns over a possible TikTok ban.”

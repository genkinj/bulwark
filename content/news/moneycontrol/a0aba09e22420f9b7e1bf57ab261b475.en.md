Bharti Airtel anticipates broadband penetration in India to double in the medium term, expanding from its current reach across 45 million homes to 80–90 million homes. Gopal Vittal, the managing director of [Bharti Airtel](https://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/telecommunications-service/bhartiairtel/BA08), made these comments in connection with the telecom major's broadband connectivity business, which continues to grow at a rapid pace.

"Broadband penetration in India remains low but is growing rapidly, driven by increasing adoption of home connectivity and evolving content consumption preferences," Vittal noted.

The company’s Homes business sustained strong growth momentum, with Q3 revenue surging nearly 19 percent year-on-year. Net customer additions hit a record 674,000, propelled by Fiber to the Home (FTTH) and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). Bharti Airtel offers FTTH services under the Airtel Xstream Fiber brand.

Despite this momentum, the company sees ample room for expansion of its competitiveness in the space. To accelerate its growth prospects, Vittal charted out three key focus areas for the company. First, Vittal emphasised on the company's plans to increase its addressable market by stepping up rollout of fiber home passes in FWA.

The second area of focus remains on improving the value that Bharti Airtel delivers. "Here, were are focused on a combination of convergence by improving the content slate we offer. Xtreme now has over 22 OTT apps as part of its platform," Vittal added.

Thirdly, the focus remains on firing up distribution channels. To this account, Vittal revealed plans to open up around 100,000 points of presence. "In addition, our 30,000 strong fleet of home delivery engineers will also be activated," Vittal added.

With these three areas ramping up, Vittal expressed confidence in sustaining growth within the Homes business, further stating that Airtel is eager to increase capital expenditure (capex) in the segment. However, he noted that the pace of expansion is currently constrained by the company’s rollout capacity. "We are keen to invest more in the segment but are currently limited by our ability to roll out home passes at scale," Vittal said.

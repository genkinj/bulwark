Britannia Industries is in the process of taking price hikes to the tune of  6-6.5 percent amid a high inflationary and low demand environment.

In the earnings call with investors and analysts for the quarter ended December, the firm's management shared that there was a two percent price hike for the quarter, while Q4FY25 will see another 2.5 percent hike. Further, Q1FY26 will see a hike of around 1.5 percent, as the company aims to protect its margins and profitability. However, the management shared that it was prepared for further adjustments if inflation persists.

"Volumes do take a beating when there is a price increase. There is an arbitrage between  
volumes and revenue, but you know, you've got to do what you want to do," said the firm's management.

"And if this inflationary trend continues, if we have to take slightly more price increases, that will be decided as we move into the next year. But we are very well prepared to be able to counter  
the inflationary trends," he added.

This license from NPCI enables RediffPay to offer Unified Payments Interface (UPI) services to its users. This marks Infibeam's entry into the digital payments sector. The company had applied for the TPAP license after acquiring a controlling stake in Rediff, in 2024.

Infibeam had in August 2024 entered in an agreement for a 54 percent stake in Rediff.com India. This internally-funded acquisition allowed Infibeam Avenues to foray into the consumer facing digital financial service as an aggregator.

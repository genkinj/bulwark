The recently announced union budget for FY26 doled out measures to revive the private consumption demand. Particularly, changes in the personal income tax structure are expected to increase disposable income in the hands of tax payers. This along with focus on improving farm income and employment generation bodes well for revitalizing rural and urban consumption demand.

Post the budget announcement, all eyes were on the RBI for supporting growth while remaining focused on bringing inflation down. As expected by the market, the MPC unanimously decided to reduce the policy rate by 25 bps to 6.25% with immediate effect. Consequently, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted at 6.0% and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.5%. The MPC also decided to continue with the neutral monetary policy stance and remain unambiguously focused on a durable alignment of inflation with the target, while supporting growth.

On the liquidity front, in the last two months liquidity tightness was largely due to advance tax payments, capital outflows, forex operations and pick up in currency in circulation. However, RBI has announced host of measures such as CRR cut, buybacks, VRR, OMO purchase and currency swap to provide adequate banking system liquidity. Focus on durable liquidity management with proactive measures should help in transmitting policy rate cuts in an efficient manner.

The culmination of fiscal measures by the government and monetary policy easing by the RBI should support achieving desired real GDP growth rate. The current growth-inflation dynamics with inflation gradually approaching its target, has provided room for a policy rate cut.

In an environment where moderating growth needs due monetary easing support, The RBI Governor's maiden speech, clearly indicated his preference for more “flexibility” with respect to the inflation targeting regime, paving the way for potential further easing.  Amidst global uncertainty and volatility, this policy rate cut will support incremental growth momentum, complementing the government's decision to ease income tax rules and boost consumption in the Union Budget 2025-2026.

Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty traded lower on February 7 despite the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) first interest rate cut in nearly five years. Investors remained cautious as the 25-basis point (bps) reduction was largely priced in and concerns over economic growth and global cues weighed on sentiment.

At around 1 PM, the BSE Sensex was down 209.93 points or 0.27 percent at 77,848.23, while the NSE Nifty slipped 46.15 points or 0.20 percent to 23,557.20. [Rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and auto, which saw initial gains](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-realty-rises-1-6-as-rbi-cuts-policy-rate-by-25-bps-lodha-godrej-properties-rises-up-to-3-12933326.html#google_vignette), also remained rangebound.

Market analysts attributed the flat reaction to the anticipated rate cut. "The move was already factored in, particularly in banking, auto, and real estate stocks, which had rallied in recent sessions but failed to find fresh momentum post-announcement," said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President at Religare Broking.

**Why Dalal Street Remains Unimpressed - 3 Factors**

**1) Growth Forecast Cut:** RBI see GDP growth for FY26 at 6.7 percent. The April-June quarter projection was lowered to 6.7 percent from 6.9 percent, while the July-September forecast was cut to 7 percent from 7.3 percent. Growth for the October-December quarter was estimated at 6.5 percent. The downward revision has raised concerns over the pace of economic recovery.

**2) Mixed Corporate Earnings:** Q3 results have failed to inspire investor confidence. Shares of ITC slipped up to 3 percent, hitting an intraday low of Rs 429.5, as the company reported a 7 percent decline in profit to Rs 5,013.2 crore. Meanwhile, Swiggy shares fell another 2 percent, hitting fresh lows after a weak quarterly performance.

As many as 37 companies that are part of the benchmark Nifty 50 index have announced their December quarter numbers and a little more than half – 19 to be precise – have missed analyst estimates with the remaining managing to better the projections, [reported](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/nifty-50-q3-27-firms-see-yoy-profit-growth-28-report-revenue-rise-12931340.html) Moneycontrol earlier this week.

Among the Nifty heavyweights, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, BPCL, Infosys, and TCS posted stronger-than-expected results. On the other hand, Coal India, ONGC, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, IndusInd Bank, and Ultratech Cement missed estimates.

**3) Weak Global Cues:** Asian markets also remained under pressure. Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 0.72 percent lower, while South Korea’s KOSPI also declined. Additionally, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued to sell equities, offloading shares worth Rs 3,549.95 crore on Thursday.

Divam Sharma, Co-Founder and Fund Manager at Green Portfolio PMS, said that while the RBI’s rate cut was expected, broader concerns around global trade, fiscal challenges, and uncertainty over the cut’s impact on growth have kept investors cautious.

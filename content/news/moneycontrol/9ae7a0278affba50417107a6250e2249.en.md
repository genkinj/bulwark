In a watershed moment for India's monetary landscape, under the leadership of the new governor  Sanjay Malhotra, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a significant shift in its policy framework on Friday, effecting a reduction in the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent - marking its first such intervention in half a decade. Concomitantly, the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rate witnessed a downward adjustment to 6 per cent, whilst both the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate and Bank Rate were calibrated to 6.5 per cent.

Whilst maintaining its stance of neutrality, the apex bank exhibited newfound flexibility in its approach towards inflation targeting, departing from its hitherto unwavering adherence to the 4 percent median target. The central bank exuded confidence in the sustained trajectory of disinflation, prognosticating average inflation at 4.2 per cent for FY26. Furthermore, it projected gross domestic product growth at a robust 6.7 per cent, approaching the upper end of the economic survey's projected range of 6.3-6.8%.

In a development of considerable import for the banking fraternity, the implementation timeline for the new Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) guidelines has been deferred until at least March 2026, with analogous extensions anticipated for project financing norms. The monetary authority, whilst refraining from announcing new steps for market liquidity, reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to ensuring adequate systemic liquidity through pre-emptive measures.

The ramifications of the rate reduction shall be most pronounced in the retail lending sphere. As of September 2024, approximately 59 per cent of floating rate advances were anchored to external benchmarks, with 37 per cent tethered to the Marginal Cost of fund-based Lending Rate (MCLR). Under the extant regulatory framework, lending institutions are mandated to reset their external benchmark-based lending rates at minimum quarterly intervals, thereby ensuring the transmission of reduced rates to borrowers during these periodic re calibrations.

This rate cut heralds particularly auspicious tidings for prospective homeowners. By way of illustration, for a 25-year housing advance of Rs 50 lakhs availed post rate reduction transmission, borrowers stand to realise savings of approximately Rs 8.16 lakh over the loan tenure, with a reduction of 20 Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) at the revised rate. Existing borrowers who contracted similar advances two years ago could potentially accumulate savings of around Rs 6.50 lakh with 15 fewer EMIs.

The monetary policy committee's decision reflects a delicate balance between fostering economic growth and maintaining price stability, whilst simultaneously addressing the emerging challenges in the global economic landscape. This calculated move is expected to catalyse credit growth across sectors, particularly benefiting SMES whilst providing much-needed impetus to the real estate sector through reduced borrowing costs.

We anticipate the benchmark 10-year yield to oscillate within the bandwidth of 6.55-6.65 per cent by March-end, with potential moderation to 6.50 per cent in Q1 FY26, contingent upon the RBI's execution of further policy rate adjustments and open market operations. The USD/INR exchange rate is projected to be in the range of 87.0-88.5. While the domestic currency might experience diminished downward pressure by mid-year, attributed to the anticipated amelioration of trade war uncertainties and the resumption of rate cuts by the United States Federal Reserve, any substantial appreciation in the rupee's value shall predominantly hinge upon the central bank's strategic approach to foreign exchange management and intervention.

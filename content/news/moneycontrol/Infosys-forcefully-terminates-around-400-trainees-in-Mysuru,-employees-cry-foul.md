Infosys
-------

 

Software major Infosys is in the process of laying off 400 trainees at its Mysuru campus after they failed evaluation tests in three consecutive attempts, according to sources familiar with the matter.

This is approximately half of the trainees onboarded in October 2024.

Infosys was not immediately available to comment on the story.

As it happens, the trainees were onboarded after a two-and-a-half-year-long wait, necessitated by a macroeconomic slowdown triggering clients of IT companies to halt spending on projects.

"This is unjustified because the tests were very tough and made to fail us, many trainees have fainted as the future looks bleak now," a trainee told *Moneycontrol* who was terminated.

Trainees are being called in batches of around 50 and are being made to sign "mutual separation" letters, sources familiar with the matter told *Moneycontrol.*

Sources say the company has deployed bouncers and security personnel to ensure that the trainees do not carry mobile phones.

Trainees have been asked to vacate the premises by 6 PM, the sources said.

Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) said it is filing an official complaint with the Ministry of Labour & Employment, demanding immediate intervention, strict action against Infosys.

“This blatant corporate exploitation cannot be allowed to continue, and we urge the government to take swift action to uphold the rights and dignity of Indian IT workers,” Harpreet Singh Saluja of NITES said in a statement.

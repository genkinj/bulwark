**Highlights**

* *The threat of major tariff sanctions by the US against India is low and the ongoing trade war with other countries is actually an opportunity*
* *What India needs to do, given its growing current account deficit, is to massively step up its exports*
* *The Union Budget for 2025-26 has announced an export promotion Mission with an outlay of ₹2,250 crore to facilitate export credit and other measures*
* *But unilateral moves by India are unlikely to change trade flow patterns much,*

Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd and its director Asmita Patel together made a little over Rs 12 lakh, or Rs 12, 28, 365 to be precise, through trading over four years.

Though the the school and its directors were promosing returns of even up to 300 percent, when selling their courses such as LMIT and MPAT, the reality of the teachers were far from that.

Asmita Patel referred to herself in hyperbolic terms such as "She Wolf of the stock market"and "options queen". But an investigation by [SEBI](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/tags/sebi.html) perhaps revealed a pack of lies, and not a pack of wolves.

In an interim cum showcause notice issued on February 6, the Securities and Exchange Board said, "As per the reply received from the stock brokers, the Noticee Nos. 1 (Asmita Patel Global School of Trading Pvt Ltd) and 2 (Asmita Patel) have earned a Net Profit (after charges) of INR 12,28,365/- during the period from 2019-20 upto January 30, 2024."

The investigation also showed that her claims of managing a portfolio of Rs 140 crores on her proprietary system was "baseless".

The order said, " Information sought from the stockbrokers of Noticee Nos. 1 and 2 stated that the turnover/volume generated by trading accounts held in the name of the Noticee nos.1 and 2 for the period from August 26, 2019 to January 31, 2024 was INR 15,27,92,283/-. The Noticee no.2 misrepresented the course participants through baseless claims such as managing a huge portfolio of INR 140 Crores on her Proprietary System... During the LMIT course and Pre-MPAT course... it was claimed that she is managing funds of INR 283 crores."

The latest movements in the gold market have caught the attention of traders, as both UBS and Citi have revised their forecasts for the precious metal significantly. Analysts at both financial institutions are anticipating an extended bull market for gold, which could present lucrative opportunities for those trading in this space.

**UBS** has upped its 12-month price target for gold to a staggering $3,000 per ounce, revising their previous forecast which was set at $2,850 per ounce. Presently, gold's price has surged to around $2,870, spurred by heightened concerns regarding tariffs and a more aggressive approach from the Federal Reserve since mid-December. Mark Haefele, leading the team of strategists at UBS, suggests that although gold's recent trading price exceeds their estimated fair value, its role as a reliable store of value continues to solidify its demand amid economic uncertainty.

UBS anticipates that this traction will not only persist but strengthen throughout the year, driven by an ongoing global cycle of rate cuts and robust buying from both institutional investors and central banks. This foresight is likely to entice active traders looking for a solid hedge against market turbulence.

Similarly, **Citi** has adjusted its projections, setting a short-term target at $3,000 per ounce and boosting its average forecast for 2025 from $2,800 to $2,900. Citiâ€™s analysis suggests that the gold bull market will continue unabated during what could be termed "Trump 2.0". Their note highlights ongoing trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over global growth as significant drivers for the increased demand for gold, particularly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and over-the-counter investments.

Despite the potential for a resolution in conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine situation and the uncertainties surrounding trade tariffs, Citi remains optimistic about gold's resilience. Notably, they predict that gold will likely be exempt from blanket tariffs proposed in the near term, reinforcing its status as an essential financial asset.

In a market environment that feels increasingly volatile and unpredictable, these heightened forecasts from UBS and Citi could encourage traders to reassess their portfolios. Gold, long lauded for its protective qualities in turbulent times, appears to be gearing up for another robust year ahead. As the allure of gold continues to shine, traders may want to keep a close eye on market movements and position themselves accordingly.

Uber Technologies (NYSE:[UBER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBER "Uber Technologies, Inc.")) rose 8% at least party after billionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman disclosed a stake in the ride-sharing and tech company.

Ackman began purchasing shares last month and owns 30.3 million shares, he said in a [posting on X.](https://x.com/BillAckman/status/1887900012937617903 " posting on X. ") 

"We believe that Uber is one of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world," Ackman wrote on X. "Remarkably, it can still be purchased at a massive discount to its intrinsic value. This favorable combination of attributes is extremely rare, particularly for a large cap company."

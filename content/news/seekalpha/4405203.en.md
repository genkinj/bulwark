Earnings Call Insights: Odfjell SE ([OTC:ODJAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODJAF "Odfjell SE")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Harald Fotland highlighted 2024 as the best financial year in Odfjell's 110-year history, with strong safety performance and operational efficiency. The company delivered a net result of $278M for the year, supported by time charter earnings of $183M in Q4, though down 10% from Q3. EBIT for Q4 stood at $68M, while the quarterly net result was $51M.
* CEO Fotland announced that Odfjell declared a dividend of $0.78 per share for H2 2024, bringing the total declared dividend per share for the year to $1.78. The company also continued its fleet renewal strategy, with three newly contracted vessels and delivery of one newbuilding in Q4.
* CFO Terje Iversen noted that general and administrative expenses increased to $20.4M in Q4, attributed to seasonal factors such as travel and consultancy expenses. He also mentioned that the company's cash and cash equivalents ended at $147M, with total available liquidity at $239M, including undrawn loan facilities.

### Outlook

* CEO Fotland expressed confidence in a strong Q1 2025, though slightly below Q4 due to reduced volumes observed toward the end of 2024. He stated that "we believe that the first quarter will be another strong quarter for Odfjell, but it will be slightly below the fourth quarter."
* Contract coverage is expected to average between 55% and 60% in 2025, according to CEO Fotland, reflecting the company's ongoing efforts to secure stable revenue streams.

### Financial Results

* Time charter earnings for Q4 were $183M, down from $202M in Q3, primarily due to reduced spot cargoes and higher off-hire days from dry-docking activities.
* Q4 EBITDA stood at $110.5M, compared to $132.3M in Q3, while net cash flow from operating activities reached $89.5M. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $44M, showing a decline from $116M in Q3.
* Earnings per share for Q4 were reported as $0.64, compared to $0.90 in Q3.

### Q&A

* Kristoffer Skeie, Arctic Securities: "Can you comment a bit on the COA increases and swing tonnage?" CEO Fotland responded, "We had an average rate increase in the fourth quarter of approximately 12%. On swing tonnage, there is a turning point around $15,000 per day where product tankers swing into chemicals."
* Jørgen Lian, DNB: "What would be the implications of a return to the Red Sea route?" CEO Fotland explained that sailing around Africa increases sailing days by approximately 25% for Middle East to Europe trades and noted that volumes have shifted to other trade routes rather than disappearing entirely.
* Frode Mørkedal, Clarksons: "How do you expect Q1 volumes to stabilize?" CEO Fotland stated that while production levels are stable, the reduction in swing tonnage is crucial for lifting volumes in the chemical tanker segment.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about reduced volumes and swing tonnage's impact on rates, adopting a slightly negative tone. Specific focus was on whether these trends would persist into 2025.
* Management showed confidence in fleet renewal and operational efficiency but acknowledged challenges in spot markets and swing tonnage effects. CEO Fotland noted, "The first quarter is expected to be another solid quarter for Odfjell."
* Compared to the previous quarter, management's tone was slightly cautious, reflecting the Q4 decline in earnings and volumes.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 guidance outcomes aligned with earlier expectations of reduced spot market contributions. Time charter earnings dropped from $202M to $183M, reflecting reduced volumes.
* Management's sentiment shifted slightly, with less emphasis on record performance and more on navigating softer market conditions.
* Analysts' focus shifted from record results in Q3 to concerns about swing tonnage and volume stabilization in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Reduced spot cargo volumes and higher off-hire days due to dry-docking activities negatively impacted Q4 performance.
* Swing tonnage continues to pose a challenge by creating a domino effect that pressures core chemical tanker markets. Management emphasized the need for patience as these dynamics normalize.
* Geopolitical risks in the Middle East and global economic uncertainty were noted as factors that could influence trade routes and volumes.

### Final Takeaway

Odfjell SE concluded 2024 with record financial performance but faced a softening market in Q4 due to reduced spot cargo volumes and swing tonnage effects. Management remains optimistic about Q1 2025, with expectations of stable volumes and continued fleet renewal. However, challenges in the spot market and economic uncertainties will require cautious navigation. The company's dividend declarations and strong cash flow underscore its financial resilience amid market headwinds.

Oil prices were on course for a third-straightly weekly fall on Friday as President Donald Trump's new tariff policies leave markets uncertain.

The opening salvo in the United States trade tariffs saw mixed oil price gainsinitially, though markets have settled lower on a weaker outlook for demandgiven the potential disruptions to trade, Fitch's BMI Research said.

"Concerns about weaker demand due to potentially reduced economic activity from the tariffs quickly began to weigh on sentiment, which ultimately led to price declines for key benchmarks."

This was also reflected in narrowing term spreads, indicating that investors now expect a loosermarket balance over the coming quarters, the brokerage said, adding that the change in sentiment was further entrenched by China's immediate response to the U.S.'s implementation of tariffsthis week, stoking fears of a slowdown in domestic Chinese economic activity.

U.S. crude futures ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM "Crude Oil Futures")) were set for a 2.4% weekly fall, and Brent ([CO1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM "Brent Futures")) down 1.4% so far this week.

BMI maintains its forecast for Brent crude to average $76/bbl in 2025,down from $80/bbl in 2024.

The brokerage further added that U.S. consumption of gasoline and natural gas ([NG1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NG1:COM "Natural Gas Futures")) appears to be most at risk, with prices rising sharply at first but paring back gains after a delay to tariffs was announced.

Gasoline ([XB1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XB1:COM "Gasoline Futures")) prices also rose sharply after the announcement of tariffs on key trade partners, with the intraday price spiking by nearly 7%, but have since retreated.

BMI's updated forecast anticipates a significant rise in Henry Hub natural gas prices from $2.4/mnBTU in 2024 to $3.4/mnBTU in 2025, driven by strong LNG export demand andimproved domestic demand.

Over the next three months, natgas futures are expected to remain around $3.0/mnBTU as domestic demand weakens, BMI added.

Investors are preparing for elevated market volatility this year, as they weigh the implications of President Donald Trump's 'America First' policies for the economy, while large-cap stocks trade at premium valuations.

At the same time, long-end U.S. Treasury yields steadily moved higher after the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates last September, reflecting expectations for fewer cuts this year.

In this backdrop, Seeking Alpha polled its readers on which 'America First' policy would affect their investments the most. The [Sentiment Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCktPUdSY7_AInARokKGxDTApvKzHVOPC0cp8S7a98ckeuRA/viewanalytics "Sentiment Survey") garnered close to 1,000 responses, with nearly half of the respondents expecting the biggest impact from tariffs and trade, while about 26% see deregulation having the most impact.

BlackRock Investment Institute sees near-term pressure for U.S. equities because of tariff risks, but "solid earnings, potential deregulation and the AI theme" support its positive 6-12 month tactical view.

"The U.S. dollar will likely build on its strength near term, but we see downside risks beyond 2025," it added. "These developments reinforce our tactical underweight on long-term U.S. Treasuries and expectation that investors will demand greater compensation for the risk of holding them."

Gregor Hirt, global investment chief - Multi Asset at Allianz Global Investors, said a diversified investment strategy - without relying too heavily on any single asset class or geography - could help traders weather market volatility.

Central banks may reassess their monetary policy plans if tariffs raise inflationary pressures. "In this environment, changes in interest rate paths and currency volatility may widen the divergence between major economies, creating opportunities for investors to benefit from differences across fixed income markets," Hirt said.

Gregory Peters, co-CIO at PGIM Fixed Income, in a recent interview with Goldman Sachs Research also pointed to sovereign bond correlations being much weaker now. "More scope for the European Central Bank to cut rates than the Fed given Europe's weaker macro picture as well as the recent sharp moves in the Gilt curve have caught my attention. So, for the first time in a long time, I see more value in sovereign bonds outside the U.S."

Earnings Call Insights: Boliden AB ([OTCPK:BDNNY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDNNY "Boliden AB (publ)")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Mikael Staffas emphasized a strong quarterly performance, with a profit of SEK 3.8 billion, supported by a one-off insurance claim of SEK 935 million and robust cash flow exceeding SEK 4 billion. CapEx for the quarter reached SEK 4.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to SEK 15 billion, slightly below guidance due to timing effects.
* Key operational achievements included record production at the Harjavalta smelter and stable output at Kokkola. The SEK 5 billion dam project in Aitik was completed on time and within budget, ensuring the mine's functionality for the next 20 years.
* Strategic developments included the announced acquisition of Lundin mining assets, Neves-Corvo and Zinkgruvan. Staffas highlighted that the dividend cancellation for 2024 will offset approximately half of the planned equity issuance to finance the acquisition.
* CFO Håkan Gabrielsson noted earnings per share of SEK 10.95 for the quarter, describing it as a "strong fourth quarter." He highlighted a mine EBIT of SEK 1.1 billion and a robust balance sheet with a net debt-to-equity ratio of 16%.

### Outlook

* CapEx guidance for 2025 was outlined at SEK 14 billion, adjusted from prior projections but maintaining the combined 2024-2025 total at SEK 29 billion.
* Smelter maintenance costs are projected to weigh on EBIT by SEK 500 million in 2025, reflecting a mid-maintenance year.
* Strikes in Finland have already resulted in a SEK 100 million impact in Q1 2025. While the situation is currently stable, management remains cautious about potential further disruptions.

### Financial Results

* Free cash flow exceeded SEK 4 billion, benefiting from reduced working capital and seasonal timing.
* Total CapEx for 2024 amounted to SEK 15 billion, below earlier guidance due to timing differences around year-end.
* Insurance-related revenues of SEK 935 million contributed to the quarter’s SEK 3.8 billion EBIT.
* The smelting operations delivered a particularly strong quarter, driven by favorable feed mix and reduced intermediate inventories. The Finnish smelters, Harjavalta and Kokkola, posted standout performances.

### Q&A

* Ola Soedermark, Kepler Cheuvreux, inquired about Aitik's mill tonnage for 2025. CEO Staffas confirmed a gradual ramp-up in throughput following the dam project's completion.
* Viktor Trollsten, Danske Bank, asked about potential production increases at Garpenberg following strong exploration results. Staffas explained that any significant expansion beyond 4.5 million tons would require a new permit, with details to be discussed at the upcoming Capital Markets Day.
* Ioannis Masvoulas, Morgan Stanley, sought clarity on the Finnish strikes' impact. Staffas noted that while current disruptions have ceased, ongoing negotiations could lead to further actions.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts raised concerns about operational challenges at Aitik and the potential financial impacts of ongoing labor negotiations in Finland. Their tone reflected a slightly negative sentiment, particularly regarding uncertainties in grades and production ramp-up.
* Management maintained a confident tone, emphasizing strong quarterly results and progress in strategic initiatives. Staffas appeared optimistic about the company's ability to mitigate risks and capitalize on operational efficiencies.
* Compared to the previous quarter, the tone showed a shift towards a more cautious approach, particularly in addressing labor disputes and Aitik's operational challenges.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance for CapEx in 2025 was adjusted down by SEK 0.5 billion, reflecting timing adjustments.
* Management's tone appeared slightly more cautious, particularly concerning labor disputes in Finland and production challenges at Aitik. In Q3, the focus was on strong production metrics without significant external disruptions.
* Analysts' concerns shifted from general operational performance in Q3 to more specific issues such as grade recovery at Aitik and the financial impacts of the Finnish strikes.

### Risks and Concerns

* Labor disputes in Finland remain unresolved, with a SEK 100 million impact already recorded in Q1 2025. Further disruptions could affect production and financial performance.
* Aitik continues to face operational headwinds, including challenges in ramping up throughput and achieving higher grades.
* Potential delays in securing new permits for Garpenberg could limit production expansion in the medium term.

### Final Takeaway

Boliden delivered a strong Q4 2024 performance, highlighted by robust cash flow, record smelter production, and the completion of major projects like the Aitik dam. Strategic moves, such as the Lundin acquisition, signal a focus on long-term growth, though risks related to labor disputes and operational challenges at Aitik persist. The adjusted 2025 CapEx guidance and strong balance sheet position the company well to navigate these uncertainties while capitalizing on market opportunities.

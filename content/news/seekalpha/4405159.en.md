Flower Foods (NYSE:[FLO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLO "Flowers Foods, Inc.")) forecast higher sales for fiscal 2025 and posted a marginal profit beat in its fourth quarter earnings report, which helped offset its revenue miss and weaker full-year profit guidance.

Shares of the company were flat in early open market trading on Friday.

For 2025, the company expects net sales to be between $5.403B and $5.487B, which is above the consensus estimate of $5.20B. Adjusted EPS was forecast between $1.11 and $1.24, which is below the consensus estimate of $1.30.

"We expect continued strong execution as we navigate a difficult economic environment in 2025. First-half results are expected to benefit from the carryover of new business wins and savings and pricing initiatives, as well as moderating commodity costs," CEO Ryals McMullian said in a statement.

In Q4, the company's adjusted EBITDA rose 7.3%, pricing/mix was up nearly 1%, and volume fell by 2.5%.

Net income for the quarter was $43.1M, or $0.20 per share, compared to $35.7M, or $0.17 per share, a year ago.

On an adjusted per-share basis, the company earned 22 cents, beating the average analyst expectation by just a cent.

Revenue fell 1.8% to $1.11B and missed the consensus estimate by $20M.

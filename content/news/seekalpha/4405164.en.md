Hershey’s (NYSE:[HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) [outlook for FY25](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404351-hersheys-hedging-strategies-sweetens-q4-bottom-line "outlook for FY25") sets a reasonable floor in which the company can grow, even if the price of cocoa does not come down, and given the company’s assumptions underpinning guidance, Citigroup’s Thomas Palmer sees more potential upside drivers than risks.

This balanced outlook prompted Palmer to upgrade Hershey (NYSE:[HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) to Neutral from Sell at the same time trimming his price target by 3% to $154 to more accurately reflect a 24% drop in the share price since the end of 2024.

Palmer also lowered his EPS estimates to reflect “persistently high cocoa prices” and Hershey’s (NYSE:[HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) somewhat subdued price response. Accordingly, 2025 EPS estimate is lowered by 16% to $6.15 and 2026 by 18% to $6.77.

There are three main items that could drive upside in Hershey’s ([HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) earnings and/or shares, Palmer says. These include lower price elasticity than the company assumes (currently 1:1 vs 0.4-0.5 for Mondelez (MDLZ)), price increases – a tool Hershey ([HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) has been mostly reluctant to use in an effort to increase merchandising, and lower cocoa prices, which Palmer admits would be “tough to count on.”

There are potentially more enduring headwinds to monitor, Palmer cautions, as the supply issues keeping cocoa prices elevated could remain for several years given the time for newly planted trees to mature. In the meantime, Hershey ([HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) has only taken incremental price actions which is expected to impact gross margin by 650-700 basis points this year. Palmer assumes another year of ~3% pricing in 2026, “but perhaps Hershey will opt for less pricing than this in hopes of driving market share,” he says.

In it’s Q4 earnings report Thursday morning, Hershey CEO Michele Buck warned that while the surge in cocoa prices will put “significant pressure on 2025 earnings” and the company will focus on driving top-line and share momentum, suggesting any price increase to offset higher input prices will remain minimal.

Hershey ([HSY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY "The Hershey Company")) shares are up another 1.5% on Friday, for a three-day gain of 10%.

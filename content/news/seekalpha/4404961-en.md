### Management View

* CEO Scott Hart highlighted a record-breaking quarter for StepStone, with fee-related earnings reaching $74 million and a $10 billion increase in fee-earning assets under management ([AUM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUM "Intl Sec Exch ISE Spot AUDUSD Index")), marking the strongest organic growth quarter in the company’s history. The total fee-earning AUM now stands at over $114 billion, a 28% year-over-year increase.
* Hart emphasized the successful deployment of $2 billion in capital and the activation of over $6.5 billion from undeployed fee-earning capital (UFEC), reinforcing the firm’s ability to seize market opportunities.
* He announced the closing of the inaugural infrastructure co-investment fund at $1.2 billion, which he described as a significant milestone for the firm’s infrastructure platform. Additionally, StepStone’s private wealth platform surpassed $6 billion in AUM, driven by $1 billion in new subscriptions, achieving its strongest private wealth growth quarter to date.
* CFO David Park reported, "Fee-related earnings were $74 million, up 46% from a year ago," adding that the quarter benefited from favorable expense timing and non-recurring advisory fees.

### Outlook

* Management remains optimistic about fee-earning AUM growth, with UFEC totaling $22 billion post-quarter. Hart stated that the remaining UFEC balance is expected to be deployed over a typical three- to five-year cycle.
* Hart also highlighted the potential for continued strong fundraising in key areas, such as the next vintages of multi-strategy global venture capital and private equity co-investment funds.
* The infrastructure platform is expected to grow further, with Hart emphasizing its importance in addressing client demand for diversification and inflation protection.

* Retroactive fees contributed $9.7 million to revenue, slightly above the $8.6 million recorded last year. The FRE margin was reported at 39%, and excluding retroactive fees, the core margin stood at 36%.
* Fee revenue from management and advisory fees rose to $192 million, up 26% year-over-year, supported by robust AUM growth and a higher blended average fee rate.

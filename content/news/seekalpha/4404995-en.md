* Odfjell SE [press release](https://st-484u2x1fcj.nf.cdn.netflexapp.com/1738865513/odfjell-se-4q24-report.pdf) ([OTC:ODJAF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODJAF "Odfjell SE")): Q4 GAAP EPS of $0.64.
* Revenue of $295.8M (-0.1% Y/Y)  misses by $8.2M.
* The time charter earnings ended at USD 183 million, compared to USD 202 million in 3Q24.
* EBIT of USD 68 million compared to USD 91 million in 3Q24.
* Net result adjusted for one-off items at USD 53 million compared to USD 71 million in 3Q24.
* Net result contribution from Odfjell Terminals was USD 2.2 million, slightly below 3Q24.
* The carbon intensity ([AER](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AER "AerCap Holdings N.V.")) for 4Q24 came in at 7.1.
* The board approved a dividend of USD 0.78 per share based on 2H24 net adjusted results.
* **Guidance:** "A reduction in swing tonnage should lead to improved volumes and earnings in the chemical tanker trades, but this is likely to first affect the tail end of the quarter. 1Q25 is expected to be another quarter of solid financial results, slightly below 4Q24 due to the lower spot volumes observed at the start of the quarter. Odfjell Terminals anticipates stable underlying results in 1Q25."

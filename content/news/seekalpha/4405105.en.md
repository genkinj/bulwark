SilverCrest Metals ([SILV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILV "SilverCrest Metals Inc.")) said its shareholders easily [approved](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995131-silvercrest-securityholders-approve-transaction-with-coeur-mining "approved") the company's acquisition by Coeur Mining (NYSE:[CDE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDE "Coeur Mining, Inc.")) at a special meeting on Thursday; the takeover is now expected to close by February 14.

The vote followed the deal's approval [earlier this week](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19988619-silvercrest-receives-mexican-anti-trust-approval-regarding-transaction-with-coeur-mining "earlier this week") by Mexico's antitrust regulator, the Comisi贸n Federal de Competencia Econ贸mica.

Coeur (NYSE:[CDE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDE "Coeur Mining, Inc.")) announced [in October](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4156400-coeur-mining-to-buy-silvercrest-creating-leading-global-silver-producer "in October") its agreement to acquire SilverCrest ([SILV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILV "SilverCrest Metals Inc.")) in an all-stock deal valued at ~$1.7B; the deal's biggest prize is the Las Chispas underground mine in Mexico, one of the world's highest-grade, lowest cost, and highest-margin silver and gold operations.

Combined with growing production from its recently expanded Rochester mine in Nevada and its Palmarejo underground mine in Mexico, Coeur ([CDE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDE "Coeur Mining, Inc.")) expects the addition of Las Chispas will generate 2025 silver production of ~21M oz from five North American operations.

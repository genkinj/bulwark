### Management View

* CEO Jule Smith announced a record revenue quarter and a 42% year-over-year revenue growth. He highlighted the acquisitions of Overland Corporation and Mobile Asphalt, expanding their operations into Oklahoma and strengthening their market share in Alabama, respectively. The acquisitions are expected to contribute $120M to $130M in revenue for the fiscal year.
* The company reported a sequential increase in project backlog to a record $2.66B, citing robust demand for infrastructure services across its geographic footprint.
* CFO Greg Hoffman reported $561.6M in revenue, driven by 11.2% organic growth and 30.4% from recent acquisitions. Adjusted net income was $13.3M, translating to $0.25 diluted EPS, a 35% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA reached $68.8M, a 68% rise compared to the prior year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.3%, up from 10.3%.

### Outlook

* Management raised its FY2025 guidance, projecting revenue in the range of $2.66B to $2.74B and adjusted EBITDA between $375M and $400M, with margins expected at 14.1% to 14.6%.
* CEO Smith emphasized ongoing acquisitions in the eight current states and potential expansions to new markets. Organic growth efforts are also forecasted to continue, with an 11% organic revenue increase in Q1 setting the tone for future quarters.
* CFO Hoffman provided additional clarity, noting a focus on deleveraging the balance sheet over the next four to five quarters, aiming to reduce the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 2.5x, down from the current 2.88x.

### Financial Results

* Q1 revenue of $561.6M exceeded analysts’ consensus estimate of $517.5M. Adjusted EPS of $0.25 surpassed the $0.15 estimate.
* General and administrative expenses declined as a percentage of revenue, from 8.9% in the prior year to 7.9% in Q1 2025.
* Cash and cash equivalents stood at $132.5M, with $393.4M available under the credit facility. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $26.8M, with FY2025 CapEx guidance remaining at $130M to $140M.

### Q&A

* Andy Wittmann, Robert W. Baird, asked about the financial contributions of the recent acquisitions. CFO Hoffman clarified that their backlog contribution is projected at $90M to $100M, with combined revenue contributions of $120M to $130M for FY2025.
* Kathryn Thompson, Thompson Research Group, inquired about gross margin trends post-acquisitions. CEO Smith noted that margins are expected to improve over time as the acquired companies benefit from CPI’s bidding strategies and operational support.
* Tyler Brown, Raymond James, questioned the potential for more liquid asphalt terminal investments. CEO Smith explained that CPI’s vertical integration strategy remains a priority, with further investments tied to achieving operational density in specific regions.
* Michael Feniger, Bank of America, raised concerns about potential funding pauses for infrastructure projects. CEO Smith reassured that no such issues have been observed, and the federal emphasis on hard infrastructure remains favorable for CPI.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Revenue increased significantly from $1.82B in FY2024 to $561.6M in Q1 2025, supported by acquisitions and organic growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved, driven by better project execution and the inclusion of Lone Star’s high-margin operations.
* The backlog grew from $1.96B in Q4 2024 to $2.66B in Q1 2025, signaling robust demand across public and private markets.
* Management’s confidence in acquisitions and organic growth strategies remained high, while analysts continued to probe funding stability and margin sustainability in light of inflationary pressures.

### Risks and Concerns

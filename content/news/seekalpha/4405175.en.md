Citi launched its coverage of Cytokinetics (NASDAQ:[CYTK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYTK "Cytokinetics, Incorporated")) with a Buy recommendation, noting that the cardiac drug developer’s recent selloff is overdone given that its lead asset, aficamten, which has a multibillion-dollar sales potential, is poised to win FDA approval.

Analyst David Lebowitz, with an $86 per share target, argued that CYTK stock has sold off since mid-2024 as low M&A prospects added to worries over the company’s plans to begin a new Phase 3 trial for its once rejected heart failure therapy omecamtiv. 

However, “pressure on shares seems overdone, given aficamten’s expected FDA approval and launch and several key upcoming data catalysts in 2025,” the analyst wrote, projecting over $3.6B in peak sales opportunity for the drug.

The cardiac myosin inhibitor is currently under FDA review, with a decision on its approval for the heart muscle disorder, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, expected [on or before Sep. 26.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4354472-cytokinetics-application-for-aficamten-accepted-by-fda)

Despite investor concerns linked to Bristol Myers’ ([BMY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY "Bristol-Myers Squibb Company")) rival therapy Camzyos, which is trailing initial projections, the analyst projected a different outlook for aficamten, arguing that it will become the “option of choice” with a superior label and less stringent prescribing requirements.

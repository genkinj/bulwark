McEwen Mining (NYSE:[MUX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MUX "McEwen Mining Inc.")) has priced a private offering of $95M aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due 2030.

The company also granted to the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase, up to an additional $15M of notes. The notes will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2025, at a rate of 5.25% per year.

They will mature on August 15, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The initial conversion rate will be 88.9284 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of ~$11.25 a share.

Net proceeds will be approximately $91.3M (or ~$105.9M if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full).

The company intends to use the funds to pay the cost of capped call overlay (~$13.1M), to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its existing credit agreement, and the remainder for general corporate purposes.

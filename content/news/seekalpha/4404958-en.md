The Board has initiated a search for a new CEO, considering both internal and external candidates. Rizvi emphasized the company’s commitment to its growth strategy during this transition.
* Synaptics announced a $198 million all-cash acquisition from Broadcom, projected to generate over $40 million in annualized sales. Rizvi stated this transaction strengthens their Edge AI strategy and broadens their wireless connectivity portfolio, including WiFi 7/8 combo devices, UWB intellectual property, and next-generation GPS/GNSS products.
* Rizvi highlighted the collaboration with Google to integrate Google's MLIR-compliant machine learning core into Synaptics' Astra processors, reinforcing their position in Edge AI solutions.
* CFO Ken Rizvi noted, "We delivered another solid quarter of growth with revenues increasing 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year to $267 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range." He also mentioned a 61% year-over-year increase in EPS to $0.92.

### Outlook

* For Q3 2025, Synaptics projects revenues of $265 million at the midpoint, with non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.85 per share at the midpoint. This includes partial contributions from the Broadcom acquisition.
* Management anticipates sequential revenue growth of approximately $10 million per quarter through the calendar year, supported by lean inventories, improved bookings, and the full integration of Broadcom assets starting in Q4.
* The Core IoT segment is expected to benefit from the Broadcom acquisition, with further contributions anticipated in FY 2026 and 2027 through expanded customer engagements in Android, AR/VR, and consumer audio markets.

### Financial Results

* Synaptics reported Q2 revenue of $267.2 million, exceeding analysts’ revenue estimate of $265.59 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.92 also surpassed analysts’ estimate of $0.86.
* Core IoT revenue grew 63% year-over-year to $61 million, driven by processor and wireless product demand. Enterprise and Automotive revenue increased 17% year-over-year, while Mobile Touch revenue declined 25% year-over-year due to the end-of-life cycle with a major U.S. customer.
* Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 53.6%, slightly above guidance, while non-GAAP operating margin reached 17.3%.
* The company ended the quarter with $596 million in cash and cash equivalents after retiring $582 million in debt and repurchasing $75 million in shares. Operating cash flow was $24 million.

### Q&A

* Neil Young, Needham & Company: Asked about the impact of the Broadcom acquisition on Core IoT. Rizvi responded, "That will actually all fall into the Core IoT segment because it's primarily wireless technologies."

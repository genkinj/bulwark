Earnings Call Insights: Yara International ASA ([OTCPK:YARIY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YARIY "Yara International ASA")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Svein Tore Holsether highlighted the company's strong operational performance in Q4 2024, achieving record-high production levels and a $90 million reduction in fixed costs since the cost reduction program's launch. Despite lower nitrogen market prices, EBITDA excluding special items decreased by 10% year-over-year.
* Holsether emphasized the improving nitrogen markets heading into 2025 and proposed an annual dividend of NOK 5 per share, reflecting Yara's commitment to increasing free cash flow and shareholder returns.
* Yara produced record-high ammonia volumes, up 4.4% compared to the prior year, excluding planned maintenance and curtailments. Finished product volumes also reached record levels, maximizing production margins.
* CFO Thor Giæver reported a negative net income of $290 million for Q4 2024, compared to a $246 million gain in the prior year, due to noncash effects including $230 million in special items and a $260 million currency loss. Underlying earnings per share fell from $0.19 in 2023 to $0.05 in 2024.
* Giæver noted Yara’s progress in its cost reduction program, achieving $90 million in savings and initiating further FTE reductions to be fully realized by 2025.

### Outlook

* Management expects tightening nitrogen markets in the coming years, driven by limited global urea capacity additions and strong demand from regions like the U.S. and India. Chinese exports remain significantly constrained.
* Yara's 2025 CapEx guidance is set at $1.2 billion, with $300 million allocated to committed growth projects, including the Sluiskil CCS initiative and new production facilities in the U.K. and Finland.
* The company plans to optimize its European ammonia sourcing to improve nitrate upgrading margins and reduce costs, leveraging imported ammonia from low-cost regions like the U.S.

### Financial Results

* EBITDA excluding special items declined by 10% year-over-year, attributed to weaker nitrogen prices. Fixed costs were $28 million lower than the prior year, reflecting progress in cost-cutting measures.
* Total deliveries increased by 5%, largely driven by nitrate and NPK products in Europe. However, clean ammonia deliveries were slightly lower due to limited availability in U.S. and Australian plants.
* Return on invested capital ([ROIC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROIC "Retail Opportunity Investments Corp.")) for the full year improved to 5%, up from 2.9% in 2023, though Q4 saw a ROIC of only 0.5% due to one-off costs.
* The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended at 1.8, toward the higher end of the target range of 1.5-2.0.

### Q&A

* **Lisa De Neve, Morgan Stanley:** Asked about the shelving of the Porsgrunn green hydrogen project. CEO Holsether explained that full conversion of the plant was paused due to factors like renewable energy pricing and grid connectivity challenges but noted ongoing efforts with economically viable green projects.
* **Christian Faitz, Kepler Cheuvreux:** Inquired about European consolidation opportunities and the Sluiskil CCS timeline. CFO Giæver stated that the company's focus is on improving existing operations and U.S. growth projects. The CCS project remains on schedule and within budget.
* **Alex Jones, Bank of America:** Asked about the sustainability of Q3 premiums and Tertre transformation costs. Giæver clarified that phosphate and potash margins were closer to historical averages, but Brazil margins were slightly above normal. No detailed cost guidance for Tertre was provided.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on sustainability of premium margins and global demand dynamics. Concerns were raised about the European operating environment and the potential impact of external market pressures.
* Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, emphasizing strong fundamentals and progress in cost reduction, but appeared slightly defensive in addressing challenges like green hydrogen and European profitability.
* Compared to Q3 2024, management's tone was consistent, focusing on strategic initiatives. Analysts showed increased skepticism regarding the company's ability to sustain recent margin improvements.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 guidance reflected a stronger emphasis on tightening nitrogen markets compared to Q3, where discussions centered on operational resilience and production records.
* Fixed cost reductions continued to progress, with cumulative savings reaching $90 million by year-end 2024, up from $45 million reported in Q3.
* EBITDA declined sequentially, reversing Q3's year-over-year growth of 47%. Noncash charges weighed heavily on Q4 results.
* Analysts' focus shifted from production performance in Q3 to market fundamentals and cost sustainability in Q4.

### Risks and Concerns

* Yara faces high feedstock costs in Europe, limiting competitiveness. Management plans to optimize ammonia sourcing and invest in U.S.-based ammonia projects to address this challenge.
* Analysts raised concerns about potential disruptions in Brazil due to drought conditions and slower-than-expected farmer demand.
* Noncash impacts, including currency losses and special items, continue to pressure earnings, highlighting the need for further cost and portfolio optimization.

### Final Takeaway

Yara International delivered strong operational performance in Q4 2024, achieving record production and significant cost reductions. However, lower nitrogen prices and noncash charges weighed on earnings, resulting in a negative net income for the quarter. Management remains optimistic about tightening nitrogen markets, driven by limited capacity additions and strong demand. Strategic initiatives, including cost optimization and U.S. ammonia investments, aim to enhance margins and shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond.

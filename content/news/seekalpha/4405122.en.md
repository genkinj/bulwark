Haemonetics (NYSE:[HAE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAE "Haemonetics Corporation")), a provider of blood management solutions, continued to trade lower in the premarket on Friday after Bank of America downgraded its shares, citing the company’s decision to lower its FY25 outlook with its Q3 results, which led to a selloff in its [stock in the previous session.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404631-haemonetics-stock-slides-on-revenue-miss)

Noting that HAE’s Q3 revenue missed forecasts amid a worse-than-expected performance from its key segments plasma and Vascade, BofA analyst Craig Bijou wrote, “The quarter likely adds to investor worries on the plasma market recovery and durability of Vascade growth.”

Downgrading HAE to Underperform from Neutral, Bijou added that given its slowdown in revenue growth, the company needs to trade at a discounted multiple compared to its peers’ low teen average.

Additionally, the Trump administration’s plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico could weigh on HAE’s performance, the analyst added, noting that compared to others in MedTech, Haemonetics (NYSE:[HAE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAE "Haemonetics Corporation")) has a higher exposure to those countries.

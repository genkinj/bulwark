Earnings Call Insights: Saputo Inc. ([OTCPK:SAPIF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAPIF "Saputo Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* CEO Carl Colizza highlighted the quarter’s performance, with adjusted EBITDA of $417 million, marking a 13% year-over-year increase, and the highest quarterly performance since Q3 2023. Revenue increased across all sectors, driven by higher sales volumes, improved domestic selling prices, and favorable global dairy market conditions.
* The company has increased its share repurchase limit under the normal course issuer bid (NCIB) from 2% to 5% of shares outstanding to maximize shareholder returns. Colizza emphasized, “Given our current share price, we believe buying back shares offers the best return on capital.”
* Significant savings of $30 million were realized this quarter in the U.S. sector, stemming from operational improvements and capital investments.
* CFO Maxime Therrien noted consolidated revenues of $5 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year increase. Adjusted earnings were $167 million, or $0.39 per share. He also disclosed a non-cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $684 million related to the U.K. division, resulting in a reported net loss of $518 million.

### Outlook

* Management withdrew its previously disclosed long-term adjusted EBITDA aspiration due to persistent market volatility. Colizza stated the company remains focused on optimizing operations, streamlining costs, and delivering growth through its diversified portfolio and strategic investments.
* In the U.S., the USDA’s new milk pricing formula, effective June 2025, is expected to positively impact dairy processors. Saputo estimated the changes could have added $60 million to $70 million to fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA if they had been implemented earlier.
* The company anticipates ongoing benefits from its operational improvements, particularly from U.S. network optimization, and remains optimistic about growth in Australia and stabilization in Argentina.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to $417 million, supported by operational efficiencies and cost savings.
* Canadian revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, supported by higher sales volumes and cost reductions. EBITDA in Canada increased by 17% to $175 million, reflecting improved operational efficiencies and a favorable product mix.
* U.S. revenue rose 12% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $160 million, a 20% increase largely attributed to operational improvements and capital investments.
* The international sector experienced a 60% revenue increase to $1 billion, but adjusted EBITDA declined to $51 million, impacted by inflation-related cost pressures and FX devaluation in Argentina. Australia showed improved results with a better alignment between milk costs and international selling prices.
* Europe reported $311 million in revenue and $31 million in adjusted EBITDA, reflecting improved retail cheese sales and operational efficiencies.

### Q&A

* Irene Nattel, RBC Capital Markets: Questioned what drove the strong Canadian performance and its sustainability. CEO Colizza attributed it to the realization of benefits from past capital expenditures and a stable workforce, adding that “more stability” is expected in Canada while the U.S. has “more in the tank.”
* Mark Petrie, CIBC: Asked about U.S. network optimization timelines. Colizza explained the Franklin consolidation will be completed by the end of 2025, with continued improvements expected.
* Michael Van Aelst, TD Cowen: Inquired about the NCIB increase. CFO Therrien noted the balanced capital allocation strategy and the undervalued stock as key drivers.
* Chris Li, Desjardins Bank: Asked if the $51 million EBITDA in the international sector marked a bottom. Colizza indicated optimism for sequential improvement, especially in Australia and Argentina.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts were cautiously optimistic, highlighting concerns over the U.K. impairment charge and ongoing market volatility while acknowledging operational improvements and cash flow strength.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing progress in operational initiatives and capital allocation strategies. During the Q&A, Colizza’s tone reflected measured optimism, particularly regarding U.S. network optimization and international sector recovery.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone was slightly more cautious due to the removal of long-term EBITDA targets, but remained confident in strategic execution.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Adjusted EBITDA increased sequentially from $389 million in Q2 to $417 million in Q3. Revenue also rose from $4.7 billion to $5 billion.
* The U.S. sector demonstrated stronger year-over-year EBITDA growth of 20% in Q3 compared to 23% year-to-date growth in Q2.
* Canada maintained robust performance, with EBITDA growth accelerating from 10% in Q2 to 17% in Q3.
* Sentiment around the U.K. division deteriorated due to the impairment charge, while optimism grew for U.S. operational initiatives and Australian recovery.

### Risks and Concerns

* The U.K. impairment charge of $684 million highlighted challenges in market recovery and persistent inflation.
* Argentina’s economic instability, including inflation and FX devaluation, continues to pressure margins and production costs.
* U.S. operations face ongoing headwinds from negative milk cheese spreads, though improvements are anticipated in Q4.
* Rising costs in Europe, including labor and utilities, pose additional risks to margins.

### Final Takeaway

Saputo delivered strong Q3 2025 results with significant EBITDA growth and progress in operational efficiencies, particularly in Canada and the U.S. The company’s decision to increase its share buyback limit underscores confidence in continued cash flow generation. While challenges persist in the U.K. and Argentina, management remains focused on cost optimization, brand investment, and strategic growth initiatives to drive long-term value creation.

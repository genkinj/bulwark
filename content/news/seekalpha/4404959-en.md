Earnings Call Insights: Viasat, Inc. (NASDAQ:[VSAT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VSAT "Viasat, Inc.")) Q3 2025

### Management View

* Mark Dankberg, CEO, highlighted that Q3 results were moderately better than expectations and confirmed the company remains on track to achieve full-year fiscal 2025 guidance. Key growth drivers include aviation, defense, and advanced technologies, while fixed broadband continues to decline as planned capacity is reallocated to higher-value markets.
* Aviation services reported significant growth, with commercial in-flight connectivity aircraft in service up 13% year-over-year and backlog growing 22%. New deals such as the full fleet expansion with STARLUX in the Asia-Pacific region were highlighted.
* Maritime services are targeting growth in fiscal 2026, driven by the NexusWave platform, which is transitioning from backlog to revenue. The order pipeline has grown, and installations are expected to ramp significantly next year.
* The CEO discussed the progress of ViaSat-3 satellites. Flight 2 is expected to launch and enter service in late calendar year 2025, covering the Americas, while Flight 3 is slated for Asia-Pacific with an in-service date likely in calendar 2026. Cost-saving launch configurations were also implemented.
* CFO Gary Chase reported Q3 revenue of $1.12 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $393 million, achieving a margin of 35%. Emphasis was placed on capital efficiency, free cash flow generation, and debt reduction as top priorities.
* Chase highlighted progress on CapEx optimization, reducing fiscal 2025 guidance by $200 million. He also noted a focus on maintaining future CapEx flat for fiscal 2026.

### Outlook

* Fiscal 2025 revenue is expected to remain flat to slightly up year-over-year, with mid-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. Fiscal 2026 guidance includes year-over-year revenue growth and modest adjusted EBITDA growth.
* Free cash flow inflection is anticipated in the second half of fiscal 2026, as ViaSat-3 satellites come online and CapEx related to their development declines.
* Maritime services are expected to return to growth starting in fiscal 2026, supported by NexusWave and ViaSat-3 Flight 2’s entry into service.

### Financial Results

* Revenue was $1.12 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, with declines in fixed broadband offset by growth in aviation, defense, and advanced technologies.
* Adjusted EBITDA reached $393 million, up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in the Defense and Advanced Technologies segment.
* Operating cash flow increased to $219 million, up over 60%, aided by reduced working capital and cash taxes. CapEx fell 40% year-over-year to $253 million, reflecting strategic prioritization and timing adjustments.
* Net loss widened to $158 million, primarily due to a $97 million non-cash loss on debt refinancing.

### Q&A

* Ric Prentiss, Raymond James: Asked about the location and timelines for ViaSat-3 satellites. CEO Dankberg confirmed Flight 2 will cover the Americas and Flight 3 Asia-Pacific, with launches planned for mid to late 2025 and early 2026, respectively. He emphasized flexibility in satellite deployment based on customer demand.
* Edison Yu, Deutsche Bank: Inquired about the potential sale of DAT assets. Dankberg stated no specific transactions are imminent but emphasized ongoing evaluations to reduce debt and unlock shareholder value.
* Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley: Asked about CapEx trends beyond fiscal 2026. CFO Chase reiterated the focus on reducing long-term CapEx and maintaining fiscal discipline while balancing customer needs.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, focusing on the company’s ability to manage debt, optimize CapEx, and deliver new satellite capacity. Concerns about competitive pressures in aviation and fixed broadband were raised.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing growth opportunities and progress on strategic priorities. However, responses during Q&A reflected some defensiveness, particularly regarding United Airlines' shift to Starlink and DAT asset evaluations.
* Compared to the previous quarter, management’s tone remained consistent, though there was greater emphasis on fiscal discipline and long-term growth.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Guidance language remained largely consistent, with fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth expectations unchanged. However, fiscal 2026 CapEx guidance was clarified, with spending expected to remain flat year-over-year at $1.3 billion.
* Strategic priorities shifted slightly, with a stronger emphasis on leveraging partnerships and optimizing capital allocation.
* Analysts’ tone was more focused on competitive dynamics in aviation and the timeline for ViaSat-3 satellites compared to Q2.

### Risks and Concerns

* Fixed broadband revenue continues to decline as capacity is reallocated to higher-value segments. Management is mitigating this by expanding aviation and maritime services.
* Competitive pressures in aviation, particularly the adoption of Starlink by United Airlines, were raised as a potential concern. Management emphasized its ability to retain customers and grow backlog.
* Delays in satellite launches or in-service dates could impact growth expectations for fiscal 2026. Management highlighted efforts to de-risk schedules and optimize capacity.

### Final Takeaway

Viasat continues to position itself for long-term growth, with strong performance in aviation and defense driving results despite ongoing challenges in fixed broadband. The upcoming launches of ViaSat-3 satellites and the rollout of NexusWave are critical to achieving fiscal 2026 growth targets. Management remains focused on improving cash flow, reducing debt, and leveraging partnerships to enhance operational efficiency and capital returns.

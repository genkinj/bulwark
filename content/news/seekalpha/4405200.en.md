Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:[META](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META "Meta Platforms, Inc.")) has given its employees a heads-up on what to expect on Monday when the social media and tech giant starts its performance-based job cuts, according to an internal memo, which was seen by *Business Insider*.

On Friday, the VP of human resources, Janelle Gale, informed staffers in a post on the company's internal forum, Workplace about what to expect in the coming week.

Gale reportedly said impacted workers will be notified by email and also receive severance package information in the same. Within an hour of being notified, those employees will lose access to company systems.

In January, top boss Mark Zuckerberg announced that he is planning to let go 5% of employees who come out as low performers at his company and intends to backfill the roles of those employees later this year.

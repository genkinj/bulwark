Stock index futures showed little movement on Friday as traders awaited the key January jobs report.

S&P 500 futures ([SPX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX "S&P 500 Index")) +0.1%, Nasdaq 100 futures ([US100:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US100:IND "NASDAQ 100 Futures")) were unchanged, and Dow futures ([INDU](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDU "Dow Jones Futures")) +0.1%.

The 10-year Treasury yield ([US10Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y "United States 10-Year Bond Yield")) was flat at 4.44%. The 2-year yield ([US2Y](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US2Y "United States 2-Year Bond Yield")) rose 1 basis point to 4.24%.

Key U.S. market averages finished mixed Thursday, as investors sorted through a new wave of earnings reports and labor-market updates, including a jump in job cuts, ahead of Friday's monthly U.S. payrolls report.

"After Monday’s trade-related slump, film scriptwriters would have been thrown out for a plot that had markets hitting or approaching their highs by the end of the week," Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.

[Amazon](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404698-amazon-solid-q4-results-upstaged-by-soft-guidance-fx-risks "Amazon") ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN "Amazon.com, Inc.")) shares were down 2.7% in premarket trade on soft Q1 guidance as well as the company’s warning regarding the negative impact from currency headwinds.

After a slew of labor data over the week, the big one lands today. The January nonfarm payrolls will be released before the opening bell. Economists on average expect a drop to 169K.

Our U.S. economists are looking for nonfarm payrolls at +175k, dipping down from the 9-month high of +256k in December. Part of that downtick is because of the Los Angeles wildfires, which occurred during the survey week, but they think the unemployment rate should remain at 4.1%, Reid added.

"Today witnesses the extreme hype of U.S. employment data. Today’s data also has annual benchmark revisions, which will confuse the headlines," UBS' Paul Donovan said.

The February consumer sentiment report will be released during market hours and is expected to come in at 71.9.

"The U.S. Michigan consumer sentiment data is mainly of use as a reminder of just how much survey polls are distorted by political bias," Donovan added.

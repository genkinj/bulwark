Social media platform X is boosting advertising through a partnership with Magnite (NASDAQ:[MGNI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGNI "Magnite, Inc.")), *Business Insider* reported Friday, as the Elon Musk-led company tries to overcome sluggishness by opening up to outside firms for ad dollars.

In November, X picked PubMatic ([PUBM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PUBM "PubMatic, Inc.")) as an official seller of its ads by making it a supply-side platform partner. Magnite also operates an SSP platform and is among the largest in the U.S.

A spokesperson for Magnite confirmed the news about the partnership to *Business Insider* and said it offers advertisers an option to include or exclude X's inventory from their media buys.

Magnite joins Google and InMobi, who also provide ad solutions to X. A previous report from *Business Insider* suggested that while InMobi is listed as a seller of X ads, it hasn't offered ads to its clients for more than a year.

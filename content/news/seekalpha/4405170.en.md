Citi has initiated coverage of Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:[VKTX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VKTX "Viking Therapeutics, Inc.")) with a neutral rating, citing the need for more data for its weight-loss drug candidate VK2735 and high barriers to entry.

The investment bank said that while the drug could show superior efficacy to available options, "we need safety data from larger and longer trials given that high discontinuations are already a challenge in the market."

Citi also noted that the obesity drug market was "highly capital intensive, a great challenge for emerging players."

"Such challenges, along with the long timelines with modest news flow, keep us on the sidelines for now," Citi added.

The bank set its price target for the stock at $38.

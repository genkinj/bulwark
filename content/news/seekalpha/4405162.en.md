Earnings Call Insights: Thule Group AB ([OTCPK:THLPF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/THLPF "Thule Group AB (publ)")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Mattias Ankarberg highlighted the company's return to profitable growth in 2024, supported by its largest product launch year ever. Key developments included the launch of three new product categories—dog transportation, child car seats, and the acquisition of Quad Lock, a market leader in performance phone mounts.
* In Q4, sales grew 7%, driven by new product launches and Quad Lock's contribution, while EBIT margin increased slightly to 0.4%. For the full year, sales grew 5%, with an all-time high gross margin of 42.7%, offset by higher SG&A costs related to product launches.
* CFO Toby Lawton reported a strong cash flow from operations of SEK2.3 billion for 2024, surpassing the company's inventory reduction target by cutting nearly SEK500 million. The company also proposed a dividend of SEK8.30 per share, adhering to its 75% net income distribution policy.

### Outlook

* The company plans to maintain its high launch pace in 2025, introducing upgraded versions of best-selling products and new offerings across its recently entered categories, such as crash-tested dog harnesses and high-back booster seats.
* Ankarberg emphasized a more front-loaded product launch strategy in 2025 to capture high-season sales, alongside a focus on scaling up recently launched categories like dog transportation and car seats.
* Thule aims to reduce inventory by an additional SEK200 million in 2025, building on its SEK1.2 billion reduction over the past two years.

### Financial Results

* Q4 revenue grew 7% year-over-year, supported by contributions from Quad Lock and new product launches, although organic growth was flat due to seasonal challenges in bike-related products and a weak RV market.
* Gross margin for 2024 reached a record 42.7%, driven by an improved product mix, increased volumes, and cost efficiencies. The adjusted EBIT margin for the year rose to 17%.
* Full-year EBIT stood at SEK1.6 billion, with strong cash flow performance supported by inventory reductions and stable CapEx at SEK263 million, or slightly under 3% of revenue.

### Q&A

* Fredrik Ivarsson, ABG: Asked about gross margin trends for 2025. CFO Lawton stated that Quad Lock positively impacts gross margins, and the company expects to sustain improvements driven by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies.
* Gustav Hageus, SEB: Inquired about organic growth assumptions for bike-related sales in 2025. CEO Ankarberg noted that Europe is back to healthy inventory levels, while North America remains in recovery mode.
* Carl Deijenberg, Carnegie: Asked about the RV market outlook. Management indicated continued weakness in Q1 2025, particularly in the OE channel, but expects inventory balancing by high season.
* Daniel Schmidt, Danske Bank: Inquired about Quad Lock's growth trajectory. Ankarberg confirmed double-digit growth for 2024 and highlighted a strong product development pipeline for 2025.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analysts expressed cautious optimism, with questions focused on market recovery and growth drivers like Quad Lock and new product categories. Concerns centered on the RV market and North American demand.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing growth through innovation and operational efficiency. In Q&A, they exhibited transparency about challenges, particularly in the RV segment.
* Compared to the previous quarter, sentiment remained stable, with management continuing to highlight resilience in a challenging market.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Q4 saw a 7% revenue increase compared to 4% in Q3, primarily due to Quad Lock's contribution and new product launches. Organic growth, however, was flat in Q4 compared to 4% in Q3.
* Gross margin improvements persisted, supported by product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. EBIT margin trends remained consistent.
* Analysts' focus shifted slightly from celebrating new launches in Q3 to addressing macroeconomic challenges and North American market recovery in Q4.
* Management's confidence in product-driven growth remained a constant theme, with a more pronounced emphasis on scalability in new categories.

### Risks and Concerns

* The RV market, especially in the OE channel, continues to face inventory challenges and production slowdowns, with no immediate recovery expected in Q1 2025.
* North American demand remains subdued, particularly among independent bike retailers, which could impact growth in bike-related products.
* Potential tariff impacts on Quad Lock, which sources components from Asia, were acknowledged but considered manageable due to strong gross margins and local production capabilities.

### Final Takeaway

Thule Group delivered a strong Q4 performance, leveraging new product launches and strategic acquisitions to drive growth despite challenging market conditions. Management remains optimistic about 2025, with a focus on scaling new categories, maintaining a high launch pace, and improving operational efficiencies. However, ongoing challenges in the RV market and North America underscore the need for cautious optimism as the company navigates a tough macroeconomic landscape.

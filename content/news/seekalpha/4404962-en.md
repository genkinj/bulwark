Earnings Call Insights: Equitable Holdings (NYSE:[EQH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQH "Equitable Holdings, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* President and CEO Mark Pearson highlighted a strong year for Equitable Holdings, showcasing 2024 non-GAAP operating earnings of $2 billion or $5.93 per share, a 29% increase year-over-year. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $6.18, up 20%, surpassing the annualized growth target of 12%-15%. Assets under management and administration exceeded $1 trillion, rising 10% year-over-year.
* The company generated $1.5 billion of cash flow to the holding company in 2024, at the high end of its guidance range, and expects cash generation to increase to $1.6 billion-$1.7 billion in 2025, with a target of $2 billion by 2027. Pearson emphasized progress on expense savings, achieving $100 million in run-rate savings and targeting $150 million by 2027.
* CFO Robin Raju stated, “non-GAAP operating earnings for Q4 were $522 million or $1.57 per share, up 18% year-over-year.” Adjusting for below-plan alternative investment income, EPS was $1.65, reflecting a 23% increase year-over-year.

### Outlook

* Equitable expects continued double-digit growth in spread and fee-based income in 2025, driven by higher average AUM balances and strong net flows across retirement, asset management, and wealth management segments. Protection earnings are forecasted to remain at the lower end of the $200 million-$300 million range, assuming stable mortality.
* Raju provided guidance for 2025, projecting alternative returns to improve to the lower end of the 8%-12% target range, starting at 5%-6% in early 2025 and potentially grading higher as market conditions improve. He confirmed, “2025 EPS growth will remain consistent with our 12%-15% target.”

### Financial Results

* Equitable reported Q4 non-GAAP operating earnings of $522 million or $1.57 per share, driven by organic growth, favorable markets, and share repurchases. Adjusted EPS of $1.65 marked a 23% increase year-over-year. GAAP net income was $899 million, significantly higher than operating earnings due to non-economic impacts from hedge portfolios.
* Strong cash flow generation of $1.5 billion in 2024 aligns with the high end of guidance, with over 50% sourced from asset and wealth management businesses. The company reduced shares outstanding by 7% during the year.
* AllianceBernstein achieved a 33% adjusted operating margin in 2024, supported by public alternative strategy performance fees and lower compensation-to-revenue ratios.

### Q&A

* Ryan Krueger, KBW: Asked about the strategic role of the Bermuda entity. CEO Mark Pearson responded that the Bermuda subsidiary provides optionality for reinsuring in-force liabilities and supporting new business while sustaining growth and achieving $2 billion in free cash flow by 2027.
* Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo: Inquired about guidance on the BlackRock LifePath Paycheck product. President Nick Lane indicated similar inflows in 2025 compared to 2024, highlighting $600 million in total flows from six plans in 2024, with additional growth expected from the $8 trillion 401(k) market.
* Suneet Kamath, Jefferies: Asked about annuity growth trends. Lane noted a 15% increase in new policy counts in 2024 and a 13% rise in average account balances, supported by strong distribution networks. CEO Pearson added that favorable demographics and bipartisan support for SECURE Act legislation remain significant growth drivers.

### Sentiment Analysis

* Analyst sentiment was slightly positive, with analysts focused on capital allocation strategies, competitive dynamics in annuities, and updates on protection earnings. Key concerns included potential volatility in alternative investment returns and competition in the RILA market.
* Management maintained a confident tone during prepared remarks, emphasizing progress on financial targets and strategic initiatives. CEO Pearson reiterated, “We remain on track to achieve our 2027 targets.” However, during Q&A, management adopted a more cautious tone, particularly when addressing competition and mortality volatility.

### Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison

* Equitable’s Q4 non-GAAP operating EPS of $1.65 outperformed Q3’s $1.59, reflecting continued organic growth and share repurchases. Assets under management and administration grew steadily, surpassing $1 trillion in both quarters.
* Management tone shifted slightly more confident in Q4, supported by strong cash flow generation and accelerated progress toward 2027 targets. Analysts’ focus evolved from short-term metrics in Q3 to longer-term strategic initiatives in Q4, such as the Bermuda subsidiary and in-plan guarantee solutions.

### Risks and Concerns

* Management highlighted challenges in the Protection Solutions segment, citing elevated net mortality claims due to limited reinsurance coverage. Raju acknowledged that volatility is expected due to the concentration of older-age policies with high face values.
* Analysts raised concerns about competitive dynamics in the RILA market, with potential pressures on pricing and market share as new entrants emerge. Lane assured that disciplined pricing and strong distribution networks will mitigate these risks.

### Final Takeaway

Equitable Holdings concluded 2024 with strong financial performance and clear momentum toward its 2027 targets. Management emphasized robust cash flow generation, progress in expense savings, and growth in retirement and wealth management segments. The company’s focus on innovation and disciplined execution positions it well in competitive markets, while strategic initiatives like the Bermuda entity and in-plan guarantee solutions offer additional growth opportunities.

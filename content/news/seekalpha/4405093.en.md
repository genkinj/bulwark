Tanabe Pharma is headquartered in Doshomachi, Osaka, and focuses on several priority therapeutic areas, including immunology & inflammation, vaccines, central nervous system, diabetes and metabolic disease.

The deal comes after [Reuters reported](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4386360-blackstone-bain-to-bid-for-mitsubishi-pharma-unit-reuters) in December last year that Blackstone ([BX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX "Blackstone Inc.")) and Bain Capital were among the final bidders for Mitsubishi Chemical Group's (OTCPK:[MTLHY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTLHY "Mitsubishi Chemical Group Corporation")) pharmaceuticals unit.

According to the report, Japanese private equity firm, Japan Industrial Partners had also made an offer for the company.

As an independent company, Tanabe Pharma will continue its licensing activities, R&D productivity, commercialization and strategic acquisitions.

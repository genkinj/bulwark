Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) slipped in afternoon trading on Friday, amid general investor anxiety over a China-U.S. trade war.

Once again, there was some negative news on the demand front after the China Passenger Car Association reported shipments of China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in January were down 11.5% from last year and 32.5% lower than December. The decline was anticipated due to the design refresh of the Model Y that impacted the Gigafactory Shanghai.

In Australia, Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) deliveries in were down 33% year-over-year in January, including a 63% drop for the Model 3 in the relatively small EV market.

The steady stream of underwhelming Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) deliveries reports from global markets is being analyzed closely by investors to determine if the Model Y refresh is the main catalyst, or if there is some pushback from consumers against Elon Musk that is moving the meter. The Model Y refresh impact should become clearer over the next few months.

For the full year 2024, Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) reported total revenue of $97.69 billion, which represented a slight increase of 1% from the prior year, but was a slowdown from the 51% revenue growth recorded in 2021 and 19% revenue growth in 2023. Of course, Elon Musk and bullish-leaning analysts have argued that Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) should be valued for its autonomous driving, robotaxi, AI, and energy storage upside.

Shares of Tesla ([TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) were down 1.6% at 12:02 p.m. and are now down more than 9% in 2025, which is a steeper decline than what has been seen for Rivian Automotive ([RIVN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIVN "Rivian Automotive, Inc.")), Lucid Group ([LCID](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LCID "Lucid Group, Inc.")), Nio ([NIO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIO "NIO Inc.")), XPeng ([XPEV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XPEV "XPeng Inc.")), and Li Auto ([LI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LI "Li Auto Inc.")), although the EV stock is still up nicely since the 2024 U.S. election.

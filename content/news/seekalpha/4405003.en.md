Security officials in the U.K. have demanded that Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) create a so-called 'back door' which would enable them to retrieve all the content any Apple user globally has uploaded to the cloud, *The Washington Post* reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The U.S. tech giant is likely to stop providing encrypted storage in Britain, rather than break its security pledge it made to its users everywhere, the report [added](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/ "added").

The U.K.'s office of the Home Secretary has served Apple with a document known as technical capability notice, ordering it to provide access, according to the report noted.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices," said a spokesperson for the Home Office, as per a report from Reuters.

Last month, U.K.'s antitrust regulator [launched](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4397726-google-apple-face-uk-antitrust-probe-over-mobile-ecosystems "launched") investigations against Google ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) and Apple (NASDAQ:[AAPL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL "Apple Inc.")) to determine if the tech companies have strategic market status in the provision of mobile ecosystem services.

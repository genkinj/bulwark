e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:[ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")) slumped in early trading due to the company lowering its annual sales and profit forecasts, citing sluggish demand in the mass beauty segment at the start of 2025. The cosmetics retailer now expects full-year net sales between $1.30 billion and $1.31 billion, down from its previous forecast, and has reduced its annual adjusted earnings per share guidance

During the retailer's earnings conference, ELF management noted that consumption trends to start calendar 2025 have been softer than we expected due to three factors.

"First, the category continued to decline in January. We believe this decline is reflective of consumers stocking up in a highly promotional December and lower social conversation around beauty. Consumer mindshare was focused elsewhere, including wildfires in LA and uncertainty around the TikTok platform."

The reaction on Wall Street to the e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:[ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")) earnings report has been strong. Both D.A. Davidson and UBS downgraded e.l.f. Beauty ([ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")) to Neutral from Buy due chiefly to margin and valuation concerns. Oppenheimer said it remains concerned with upcoming difficult sales comparisons and recommended that investors stay on the sidelines with ELF. The firm continues to prefer Ulta Beauty ([ULTA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULTA "Ulta Beauty, Inc.")) over both Estee Lauder ([EL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EL "The Est√©e Lauder Companies Inc.")) and e.l.f. Beauty ([ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")). Raymond James removed ELF from its favorites list.

Shares of e.l.f. Beauty ([ELF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELF "e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.")) swung 20.5% lower in the first 30 minutes of trading on Friday. Ulta Beauty ([ULTA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULTA "Ulta Beauty, Inc.")) was down 2.66% and Nu Skin Enterprise ([NUS](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUS "Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.")) was 2.26% lower. Sally Beauty ([SBH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBH "Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.")), Coty ([COTY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COTY "Coty Inc.")), Beauty Health Company ([SKIN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SKIN "The Beauty Health Company")), Helen of Troy ([HELE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HELE "Helen of Troy Limited")), and Interparfums ([IPAR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPAR "Interparfums, Inc.")) were all in negative territory as well.

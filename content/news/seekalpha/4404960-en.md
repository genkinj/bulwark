Earnings Call Insights: Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:[NBIX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIX "Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* CEO Kyle Gano highlighted Neurocrine's transformation into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. He emphasized the strong performance of INGREZZA, which is poised for double-digit year-over-year growth despite moderated expectations compared to 2024, the company’s highest growth year to date. He also stressed the potential of CRENESSITY to become the company’s second blockbuster therapy, citing its groundbreaking profile for congenital adrenal hyperplasia ([CAH](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAH "Cardinal Health, Inc.")).
* CFO Matt Abernethy projected INGREZZA sales for 2025 to range between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, reflecting $250 million growth at the midpoint. He noted increased competitive pressure and payer utilization management as key factors moderating growth. Abernethy also outlined 2025 operating expense priorities, including investment in the CRENESSITY launch and advancing Phase 3 programs for osavampator and NBI-568.
* Chief Commercial Officer Eric Benevich noted that INGREZZA achieved record annual sales growth of approximately $475 million in 2024. He emphasized significant untapped potential, with 90% of the estimated 800,000 tardive dyskinesia patients in the U.S. still untreated. Benevich also described CRENESSITY as a potential game-changer in CAH treatment, with early enthusiasm from endocrinologists and patients.

### Outlook

* Management guided INGREZZA sales to reach between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion in 2025, supported by an expanded sales force and ongoing direct-to-consumer initiatives.

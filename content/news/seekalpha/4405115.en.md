**Update 9:08am**: Adds Elliott confirmation, statement.

Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) rose 4% in premarket trading as Elliott Investment Management confirmed it has a large stake in the industrial software company and is opposed to the terms of Emerson Electric's ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) $265 a share takeover. 

"As the largest minority investor in AspenTech, we disagree with the Company's decision to support a $265.00 per share tender offer by its majority stockholder, Emerson, to acquire the AspenTech shares it does not already own," Elliott said in a [statement](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995594-elliott-statement-on-aspen-technology-inc " statement ")  on Friday. "Emerson's offer is highly opportunistic and substantially undervalues the Company. Elliott has no intention of tendering its shares at the current price."

Elliott's stake is valued at more than $1.5 billion.

News of the Elliott's 9% stake and opposition to the Emerson ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) deal was earlier reported by Bloomberg. Aspen Tech couldn't immediately be reached by Bloomberg for comment.

Late last month, Emerson ([EMR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMR "Emerson Electric Co.")) agreed to buy the shares of Aspen Technology (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) it didnâ€™t own for [$265 a share.](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398828-emerson-electric-agrees-to-acquire-remaining-aspen-stock-for-7_2b " $265 a share.")Emerson in November originally proposed to buy Aspen (NASDAQ:[AZPN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZPN "Aspen Technology, Inc.")) [for $240 per share](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4247336-emerson-offers-to-buy-rest-of-aspen-tech-for-240-share-in-cash " for $240 per share ")  and boosted its offer to $265 last month.

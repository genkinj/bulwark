* Verily, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:[GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG "Alphabet Inc.")) (NASDAQ:[GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL "Alphabet Inc.")) health tech unit has agreed to sell its stop-loss insurance subsidiary, Granular Insurance Company, to the managed care firm Elevance Health.
* Launched in 2020 with the backing of the commercial insurance unit of the Swiss Re Group, Granular served self-funded employers with a data-driven approach to risk management.
* With its revenue surging nearly sixfold to $151M over the first nine months of 2023, the company, initially known as Coefficient Insurance Company, has become a compelling buyout target.
* The deal, first reported by Business Insider, marks Verily’s latest business pivot. Launched in 2015, Google's sister firm switched to precision medicine in 2022 after initially focusing on developing hardware like continuous glucose [monitoring devices](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/alphabets-verily-to-sell-insurance-business-to-elevance-health.html) and later moving to pandemic response during the COVID-19 outbreak.
* The terms of the deal were not available.

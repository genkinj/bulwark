AB SKF ([OTCPK:SKFRY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SKFRY "AB SKF (publ)")) Friday launched a consent solicitation to holders of its notes, about the contemplated spin-off and to confirm that it will not cause an event of default under the conditions of the notes.

SKF is seeking consent as a matter of prudence and to avoid any potential uncertainty in the future, [it said in a statement.](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995297-skf-continues-the-preparations-for-the-separation-of-its-automotive-business-initiates " it said in a statement.")

SKF does not consider that there has been an event of default under any series of the notes.

SKF ([OTCPK:SKFRY](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SKFRY "AB SKF (publ)")) does not expect the contemplated spin-off to have any negative impact on its strategy, operational or financial conditions of SKF. “This implies that the contemplated spin-off would not impact the solvency of SKF and its financial structure would remain solid.”

SKF is offering a 0.25% (as a percentage of the principal amount) early voting fee to Noteholders who vote in favour of the approvals at or prior to the applicable early instruction deadline.

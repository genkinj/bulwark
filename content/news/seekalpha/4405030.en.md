Sales of Tesla's (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) China-made electric vehicles fell 11.5% year-on-year to 63,238 units in January, as intense market competition continues to disrupt the automaker’s share of China's EV market.

According to data from the China Passenger Car Association, shipments of China-made Model 3 and Model Y vehicles were down 32.6% from December last year. Tesla's China-made EV sales, including exports to Europe and other markets, were down 0.4% from a year earlier to 93,766 units in December.

However, deliveries fell for the fourth consecutive month when compared to last year, despite an increase in subsidies from the Chinese government to attract more consumers.

The performance also lags major Chinese rivals by a significant margin. Chinese rival BYD ([OTCPK:BYDDF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF "BYD Company Limited")) announced strong growth in both production and sales volumes for January, with sales of its passenger vehicles up 47.5% Y/Y to 296,446 units.

Other local EV competitors, including NIO ([NIO](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIO "NIO Inc.")) and XPeng ([XPEV](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XPEV "XPeng Inc.")) also reported higher sales on an annual basis.

Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA "Tesla, Inc.")) were down 1.46% premarket on Friday.

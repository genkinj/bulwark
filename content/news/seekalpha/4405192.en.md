Green Plains (NASDAQ:[GPRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPRE "Green Plains Inc.")) -15.6% in Friday's trading to its lowest in nearly five years after posting a much larger than expected [Q4 GAAP loss](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405053-green-plains-gaap-eps-of-0_86-misses-by-0_49-revenue-of-584m-misses-by-46m "Q4 loss") and launching a corporate reorganization and cost reduction initiative, as the company suffers from a weak domestic ethanol market.

Green Plains (NASDAQ:[GPRE](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPRE "Green Plains Inc.")) said its revamp, which will include a smaller workforce, over the next few months will seek to save up to $50M annually, and the board is continuing its strategic review to consider options, including a possible sale.

The cutbacks will include the idling of its Fairmont, Minnesota facility due to sustained localized margin pressure from the flooding that occurred in the region, the company said.

Q4 swung to a net loss of $54.9M, or a loss of $0.86/share, from a net profit of $7.2M, or $0.12/share, in the year-earlier quarter, and revenues sank 18% Y/Y to $584M from $712.4M for the same period in the prior year.

"Ethanol blending continues to inch higher and with several idled plants across the industry, including Fairmont, we expect to see ethanol physical stocks improve as we move through the year, which could lead to a more constructive environment," CEO Todd Becker said.

Chevron (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX)) is accelerating its $48B expansion of Kazakhstan's Tengiz oilfield, raising its production to ~1% of global crude supply, Reuters reported Friday.

Expansion of the Kazakh oilfield has suffered delays and huge cost overruns since it began in 2012.

Chevron's (NYSE:[CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) head of international E&P Clay Neff told Reuters [last month](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4398419-chevron-led-giant-kazakhstan-oilfield-produces-first-oil-from-48b-expansion) that the Tengiz expansion was expected to reach full capacity of 260K bbl/day by June, raising its overall production to ~1M boe/day.

The company could complete the ramp-up of the expansion by the end of February, four months earlier than expected, according to the [report](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-accelerates-kazakh-oilfield-ramp-up-sources-say-2025-02-07/), which also said a source believes oil production at Tengiz already has reached 900K bbl/day, up from the field's 606K bbl/day average in 2024.

Kazakhstan frequently exceeds its output quota of 1.468M bbl/day under the production-curbing deal struck by OPEC+, and the speedy expansion of the Tengiz field may complicate efforts to restrain the country's overall oil production in line with quotas agreed by the group.

Chevron ([CVX](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX "Chevron Corporation")) is operator of the Tengizchevroil joint venture and owns a 50% stake, Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM "Exxon Mobil Corporation")) hold 25%, Kazakh oil firm KazMunayGas holds 20% and Russia's Lukoil has the remaining 5%.

AltaGas ([OTCPK:ATGFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATGFF "AltaGas Ltd.")) and Keyera ([OTCPK:KEYUF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEYUF "Keyera Corp.")) said Friday they entered into [long-term agreements](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19995422-altagas-and-keyera-announce-agreements-that-leverage-each-companys-infrastructure-to-drive "long-term agreements") they say will leverage each company's infrastructure to increase export capacity to reach diversified markets for liquefied petroleum gas.

In one of the agreements, Keyera ([OTCPK:KEYUF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEYUF "Keyera Corp.")) signed a 15-year tolling contract at AltaGas' ([OTCPK:ATGFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATGFF "AltaGas Ltd.")) Ridley Island energy export facility for 12,500 bbl/day of liquefied petroleum gas export capacity that build on existing volumes that Keyera currently flows through AltaGas' Ridley Island propane export terminal.

The companies said the new agreement will provide Keyera ([OTCPK:KEYUF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEYUF "Keyera Corp.")) the ability to offer its customers more diversified market access for LPGs, including premium Asian markets, while providing AltaGas with long-term ratable export volumes and cash flows.

AltaGas ([OTCPK:ATGFF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATGFF "AltaGas Ltd.")) also entered an 18-year agreement for 8K bbl/day of fractionation capacity at Keyera's ([OTCPK:KEYUF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEYUF "Keyera Corp.")) Fort Saskatchewan, which includes NGLs that will be produced from AltaGas' Pipestone II plant currently under construction, as well as contracting access to Keyera's rail, storage and logistics infrastructure in Alberta, which connects LPG volumes into AltaGas' global exports' network.

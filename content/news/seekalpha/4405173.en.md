Earnings Call Insights: Danske Bank A/S ([OTCPK:DNSKF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNSKF "Danske Bank A/S")) Q4 2024

### Management View

* Danske Bank reported a net profit of DKK 23.6 billion for 2024, exceeding its guidance range of DKK 22.5 billion to DKK 23.5 billion. CEO Carsten Egeriis attributed the strong performance to an 8% increase in core banking income and strategic progress in areas like technology transformation and customer relations expansion. The bank achieved a return on equity of 13.4%, the highest since 2018.
* The bank announced a dividend payout of DKK 22.2 per share, including an extraordinary dividend of DKK 5.35 per share. Additionally, Danske Bank plans a DKK 5 billion share buyback program starting next week.
* CFO Stephan Engels highlighted that the cost-income ratio improved to 46%, down from 49% in 2023, supported by stable operating expenses and efficiency enhancements. Net reversals of DKK 2.5 billion in loan impairment charges also contributed to the results.

### Outlook

* The bank projects a net profit of DKK 21 billion to DKK 23 billion for 2025, driven by slightly lower total income, stable operating expenses, and a loan impairment charge of approximately DKK 1 billion. Danske Bank expects net interest income to exceed DKK 35 billion in 2025, supported by deposit hedging and growth in lending volumes.
* CEO Carsten Egeriis noted, "Core income will continue to benefit from strong fee income and our continued efforts to drive commercial momentum and growth in line with our financial targets for 2026."

### Financial Results

* Total income for 2024 reached DKK 56.4 billion, marking progress towards the 2026 target. Fee income surged 35% quarter-on-quarter in Q4, bolstered by strong performance fees in asset management.

* Danske Bank maintained a strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 17.8% after accounting for dividends and the new share buyback program.

### Q&A

* Mattias Nilsson, Nordea, asked about net interest income dynamics for 2025. CEO Egeriis confirmed expectations of slightly lower NII compared to 2024, driven by stable volumes and margins. CFO Engels added, "We are guiding towards above DKK 35 billion as the level that we see right now."
* Namita Samtani, Barclays, inquired about the strategy in Sweden, highlighting competitive pricing challenges. CEO Egeriis emphasized the focus on mass affluent and high-end customer segments, indicating progress in improving profitability.

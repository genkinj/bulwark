* The generative artificial intelligence chatbot created by Chinese AI company DeepSeek ([DEEPSEEK](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK "Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.")) will be banned on Canadian government devices, Bloomberg reported.
* “Due to serious privacy concerns associated with the inappropriate collection and retention of sensitive personal information, and as a precautionary measure to protect government networks and data, it is recommended that departments and agencies restrict the use of the DeepSeek chatbot on government devices,” Canada's Chief Information Officer Dominic Rochon wrote in an email to government departments in the country, the news outlet added, citing the email.
* Shared Services Canada, the government agency in charge of Canada's information technology network, has already banned the app.
* Earlier this week, U.S. lawmakers put [forth](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4404467-us-lawmakers-to-introduce-bill-to-ban-deepseek-on-government-devices "forth") legislation that would see the chatbot banned on all U.S. government devices.
* DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha.

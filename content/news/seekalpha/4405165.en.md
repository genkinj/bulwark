Alpha and Omega Semiconductors (NASDAQ:[AOSL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AOSL "Alpha and Omega Semiconductor Limited")) shares climbed during Friday trading after the company secured a deal to provide crucial components for Nvidia's (NASDAQ:[NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA "NVIDIA Corporation")) GB300 NVL72.

TF International Securities analyst [Ming-Chi Kuo](https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1887877950235894017 "Ming-Chi Kuo") said Alpha and Omega was confirmed as the primary DrMOS supplier for the GB300 NVL72, a high-performance AI server platform designed for large-scale AI inference.

"Recent Nvidia validation confirms AOS as the primary DrMOS supplier with 70% market share," Kuo said in a blog post. "To ensure smooth delivery amid robust demand for AOS's production capacity, Nvidia placed orders early, with AOS expected to ship 50–60M units for 2Q25." 

Monolithic Power Systems ([MPWR](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPWR "Monolithic Power Systems, Inc.")) was also identified as a supplier for the GB300 NVL72. Monolithic shares climbed 7% during Friday trading.

DrMOS stands for Driver metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors — and is a type of power module to control conductivity of electric signals. 

"MPS will ship controllers that work with AOS DrMOS, with expected shipments of ~1.2M units in 2Q25," Kuo noted. "Due to specification upgrades, GB300 NVL72 requires ~60% more controllers per rack compared to GB200 NVL72." 

"Thanks to Nvidia's early DrMOS orders, AOS's 2025 revenue is expected to grow 10% YoY (vs. market consensus of 2–4%)," Kuo added. "The company could break even as early as 2Q25, with further profit improvements in 2H25 — beating market expectations of continued losses through 2Q-3Q25."

Alpha and Omega reported its second quarter fiscal 2025 [financial results](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4403925-alpha-and-omega-semiconductor-non-gaap-eps-of-0_09-beats-by-0_01-revenue-of-173_2m-beats-by "financial results") on February 5. Its adjusted earnings per share of $0.09 was just above the consensus estimate of $0.08. Revenue of $173.2M was also more than the consensus of $170.1M.

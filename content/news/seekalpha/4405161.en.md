The outlook assumes that same-property net operating income rises at least 2% and total acquisitions of $100M-$125M at blended cap rate of 7.0%-8.0%.

Q4 FFO per share of $0.42, matching the consensus, fell from $0.43 in Q3 and rose from $0.39 in Q4 2023.

Q4 revenue of $525.4M, vs. the consensus of $512.6M, increased from $507.6M in the previous quarter and $451.6M a year ago.

Pro-rata leased occupancy was 96.3% at quarter end vs. 96.4% in the prior quarter and 96.2% a year ago.

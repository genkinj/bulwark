### Management View

* CEO David Brown highlighted record performance metrics, including $1.45 adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. Total client assets reached $176.1 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Strong sales in the rules-based and active ETF platform, Victory Shares, contributed significantly to this growth.
* Brown reaffirmed the expected closing of the Amundi acquisition by the end of Q1 2025, with $100 million in cost synergies projected within two years, mostly front-loaded in the first year. The integration is anticipated to expand non-U.S. AUM to over $45 billion.
* CFO Michael Pilicarpo reported fourth-quarter revenue of $232.4 million, the highest in the company’s history, driven by a 2% increase in average assets under management. Adjusted EBITDA reached $125.5 million, accompanied by a 54% margin, both setting quarterly records.

### Outlook

* Brown expressed optimism for 2025, emphasizing the potential of the Amundi acquisition and a strong pipeline of won-but-not-yet-funded mandates. He highlighted anticipated benefits from integrating Victory products into Amundi’s global distribution network, with specific product launches planned throughout 2025 and into 2026.
* Pilicarpo noted ongoing evaluation of the ETF platform, with plans to leverage Amundi’s existing infrastructure to accelerate Victory product distribution globally. The company remains confident in achieving a long-term adjusted EBITDA margin of 49%, even post-integration.
* The management reiterated its focus on launching innovative ETFs and expanding intermediary and institutional distribution channels to sustain organic growth.

### Financial Results

* Adjusted net income with tax benefit rose to $95.1 million in Q4, a 7% sequential increase. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.45 marked a quarterly record and a 19% year-over-year increase for the full year.
* Total revenue for 2024 reached $893 million, up 9% from 2023. The average fee realization rate increased to 52.5 basis points in Q4.
* The company returned $132.4 million to shareholders in Q4, including 1.5 million shares repurchased and a 7% dividend increase. The dividend for Q1 2025 was set at $0.47 per share.

### Q&A

* Kenneth Lee, RBC Capital Markets: Inquired about the timeline for introducing Victory products to Amundi’s non-U.S. distribution. Brown outlined a phased approach, starting with existing Amundi U.S. products and later integrating Victory strategies by late 2025 or early 2026.
* Mason, Barclays: Sought updates on Amundi’s performance. Pilicarpo confirmed that Amundi U.S.’s 2024 net flows of $2.6 billion and $114 billion in AUM exceeded expectations.

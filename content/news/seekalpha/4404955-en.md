### Management View

* CEO Peter Karlstromer highlighted the company’s transition into a simpler, more efficient structure under the one-GN strategy, which delivered $430 million in synergies during the year, exceeding plans. He also emphasized strong overall execution, profitable growth, and market share gains in key divisions.
* GN Hearing posted a 10% organic growth for the year, driven by the success of the Nexia hearing aid portfolio, with broad-based growth across regions and channels. The newly launched AI-powered ReSound Vivia platform is expected to revolutionize signal processing and further boost growth.
* The Enterprise division saw market stabilization, with GN maintaining its leading position in headsets and gaining market share in video. Despite negative growth for the year, margins improved through pricing discipline and synergies.
* SteelSeries, part of the Gaming division, achieved double-digit growth in Q4, making it the strongest quarter ever for the brand, supported by innovation and robust demand.
* CFO Soren Jelert reported a 79% increase in EBITA for 2024, driven by gross margin improvements to 53.2% and cost synergies from the one-GN transformation. The year ended with a $1.1 billion free cash flow and reduced leverage to 3.5x.

### Outlook

GN Hearing anticipates 5%-9% growth, supported by new launches like ReSound Vivia and Savi. Enterprise forecasts 0%-4% growth, reflecting a modestly improving market. Gaming projects 7%-12% organic growth.
* GN targets a reported EBITA margin between 12%-14%, with tailwinds from additional synergies and the absence of extraordinary wind-down costs from 2024.
* Management assumes a healthy 4%-6% volume growth in the hearing aid market, aligned with historical trends, and aims to gain further market share.

* Free cash flow, excluding M&A, reached $1.1 billion, driven by strong operational cash flows and positive working capital effects.

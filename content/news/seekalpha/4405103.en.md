Frontier Group Holdings (NASDAQ:[ULCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC "Frontier Group Holdings, Inc.")), the parent company of Frontier Airlines, swung to a profit in the [fourth quarter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4405100-frontier-group-beats-q4-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-fy25-outlook "fourth quarter") as efforts to improve efficiencies coupled with a 12% increase in revenue resulted in a profit of $0.23 per share, 10 cents above Wall Street’s [expectations](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC/earnings "expectations").

Shares were elevated ahead of Friday’s close, putting the stock on track to trade in the green for a second day after a string of losses.

"Our revenue and network initiatives contributed to record fourth quarter revenue, setting us on a trajectory for significant year-over-year [revenue per available seat mile] growth in 2025 which underpins our target of achieving double-digit adjusted pre-tax margins in the summer of 2025," Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said.

The carrier’s operating expenses were down 6.7%, driving up its operating margin by 430 basis points to 5.1%.

Revenue per available seat mile, or RASM, increased 15%, as the carrier focused on maximum capacity during peak days of the week, while cost per available seat mile (“CASM”) excluding fuel costs increased by 21% due to a 15% reduction in average daily aircraft utilization and increase in airport costs. For the year, however, CASM was down 1.2% to $0.644 cents.

As the carrier’s revenue and network initiatives continue to gain traction, it expects to break even or report a profit of $0.07 per share versus expectations for a loss of $0.04 per share. For 2025, Frontier (NASDAQ:[ULCC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC "Frontier Group Holdings, Inc.")) is looking to earn a profit of $1.00 per share, beating the [consensus estimate](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ULCC/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly "consensus estimate") by $0.38.

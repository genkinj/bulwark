SKF (SKF-B.ST, SKF-A.ST) commenced a consent solicitation with its noteholders for the proposed plan to spin off and separately list its automotive unit on Nasdaq Stockholm.

The Swedish bearings and seals manufacturer is looking for confirmation from noteholders that the separation will not constitute an event of default, according to a Friday release.

SKF offered an early voting fee of 0.25% of the principal amount of the notes to noteholders who would vote in favor of the proposal by the early instruction deadline.

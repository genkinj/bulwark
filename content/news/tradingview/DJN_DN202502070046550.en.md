Aurubis is off to a solid start after a series of setbacks and headwinds in the primary smelting markets, Deutsche Bank Research analyst Bastian Synagowitz says in a research note. The German metals supplier posted first-quarter operating pretax earnings in line with expectations and a free-cash-flow that was significantly better than expected, the analyst says. "This should put the company well on track to achieve unchanged guidance." Shares trade 1.5% higher at 81.45 euros. (nina.kienle@wsj.com)

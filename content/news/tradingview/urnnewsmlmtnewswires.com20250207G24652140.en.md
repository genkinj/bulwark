Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary may impose production cuts and lay off 1,500 workers unless the European Commission eases the tariffs imposed on Chinese-made electric cars, Reuters reported Friday.

In an interview with the news outlet, SEAT Chief Executive Officer Wayne Griffiths said the carmaker does not have much time, adding that resolution is needed before the first quarter.

Griffiths added that the tariff must be "as close as possible" to the 10% tariff before the additional 20.7% was imposed for the company to reconsider its decision.

Central European currencies clung on to recent gains on Friday amid hawkish signals on interest rates from central bankers and optimism about a possible end to the [war in Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-russia-war/).

The Czech National Bank resumed its interest rate-cutting cycle on Thursday, lowering the main two-week repo rate by 25 basis points while sounding caution on the pace of further easing, given persistent risks from service price inflation.

Meanwhile, Poland's central bank governor, Adam Glapinski, said that above-target inflation meant there were no grounds for cutting interest rates at the moment.

"The Polish central bank governor didn't say anything that could bring interest rate cuts closer than late 2025, early 2026," said Marcin Sulewski, CEE Economist at Ipopema Securities.

"And yesterday, the Czech Central Bank also sounded rather hawkish (saying) that there's not much room to cut interest rates, so this was positive."

The Polish zloty and Czech crown were steady versus the euro at 4.1915 and 25.08 respectively.

Sulewski added that increased hopes of an end to the Russia-Ukraine war had also boosted markets recently.

Analysts also said that markets would be watching U.S. payrolls data.

Ukraine is prepared to engage in negotiations to end the war, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday, but he stressed that the U.S. and Europe must take part in any talks.

Meanwhile, the Hungarian forint held onto its gains from the previous session to trade at 404.60, after also having been boosted by hawkish comments from a central banker.

Hungarian rate-setter Gyula Pleschinger told Reuters on Thursday that he saw no opportunity for interest rate cuts this year. He said Hungary's average inflation rate could rise to 4.1% or 4.2% this year, with possible U.S. tariffs on European imports posing upside risks.

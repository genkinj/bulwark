Ukraine's foreign currency reserves stood at $43 billion as of February 1, the central bank said on Friday.

"In January, international reserves fell by 1.8%, but remain close to the record-high level," the regulator said in a statement.

The regulator cited interventions in the foreign exchange market, payments for servicing public debt and revaluation of financial instruments as factors of change.

During 2024, foreign currency reserves grew by 8%, according to the bank's data, as Ukraine received nearly $42 billion in foreign financial aid.

In repelling Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv relies heavily on foreign assistance.

Ukraine received more than $115.2 billion in foreign aid in the past three years, the finance ministry data showed.

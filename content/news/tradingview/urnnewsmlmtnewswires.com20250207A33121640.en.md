Stellantis said it deepened collaboration with Mistral AI to integrate artificial intelligence across multiple areas, from vehicle engineering to in-car experiences.

According to a statement early Friday, the firms have worked together for over a year on projects such as vehicle engineering, fleet data analysis, internal car sales, and manufacturing.

Stellantis said Mistral's expertise in large language models is helping quickly analyze large datasets to improve manufacturing quality and reduce development times. It said Mistral's latest initiative is an AI-powered in-car assistant serving as a voice-enabled user manual for drivers.

Singapore's foreign exchange reserves grew to SG$510.6 billion in January 2025 from SG$506.7 billion in December 2024, preliminary data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore showed Friday.

The increase was mainly driven by the month-on-month increase in gold and foreign exchange to SG$500.5 billion during the month from SG$496.5 billion in the preceding month.

However, the city-state's special drawing rights fell to SG$8.37 billion from SG$8.41 billion, and the International Monetary Fund reserve position dropped to SG$1.74 billion from SG$1.76 billion, according to the report.

In US dollar terms, total foreign exchange reserves stood at $376.7 billion in the first month of the year.

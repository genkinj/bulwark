GrafTech International Ltd., a leading manufacturer of high-quality graphite electrode products essential to the production of electric arc furnace steel and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31,Â 2024. The company has successfully executed initiatives to grow volume, reduce costs, and manage working capital levels, despite facing industry-wide challenges.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, GrafTech reported net sales of $134 million, a slight decrease from $137 million in the same period of 2023. The company recorded a net loss of $49 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to a net loss of $217 million, or $0.85 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $7 million, showing an improvement from negative $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

On a full-year basis, net sales were $539 million, down from $621 million in 2023. The net loss for the year was $131 million, or $0.51 per share, compared to a net loss of $255 million, or $0.99 per share, in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was $2 million, a decline from $20 million in the prior year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

GrafTech achieved a 13% year-over-year increase in sales volume for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2024. The company also reported a 25% reduction in cash costs per metric ton (MT) for the fourth quarter and a 23% reduction on a full-year basis. Production volume for the fourth quarter was 25.1 thousand MT, a 3% increase compared to the same period in 2023.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

During the fourth quarter, GrafTech completed financing transactions that bolstered its liquidity and extended debt maturities. The company ended 2024 with total liquidity of $464 million, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $256 million, $108 million of availability under its amended revolving credit facility, and $100 million of availability under new senior secured first lien delayed draw term loans. Gross debt stood at $1.125 billion, with net debt at approximately $869 million.

**Management's Perspective**

Timothy Flanagan, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, "We successfully delivered on our stated initiatives for 2024 to grow volume and market share, to cut costs, and to manage our working capital and capital expenditure levels. As we enter 2025, we remain relentlessly focused on managing what is within our control. However, as graphite electrode demand remains muted and competitive pressures have persisted in many of our key regions, the pricing environment remains unsustainably low."

Flanagan also highlighted the company's intention to increase prices by 15% on volume that is not yet committed for 2025 and initiatives to optimize the order book and shift the geographic mix of the business to regions with higher average selling prices.

**Future Outlook**

Looking ahead to 2025, GrafTech anticipates a low double-digit percentage point year-over-year increase in sales volume as it continues to regain market share. The company expects a mid-single digit percentage point decline in cash cost of goods sold per MT for 2025 compared to 2024. Capital expenditures for 2025 are projected to be approximately $40 million.

Despite industry-wide headwinds, GrafTech remains confident in the long-term growth prospects driven by the steel industry's efforts to decarbonize and the increasing demand for petroleum needle coke in the electric vehicle market.

U.S. natural gas spot prices fell at most locations in the week ended Feb. 5, with the benchmark Henry Hub spot price decreasing by US$0.07 to US$3.22/million British thermal units week-over-week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its Natural Gas Weekly Update released Thursday.

Liquefied natural gas prices in East Asia gained US$0.32 to US$14.40/MMBtu, the EIA reported, citing data from Bloomberg Finance. Natural gas prices at the Title Transfer Facility in Europe rose US$1 to US$16.08/MMBtu.

The U.S. natural gas supply increased by 1.6%, driven by growth in dry natural gas production, resulting in the highest weekly average ever recorded, the EIA said.

U.S. natural gas consumption dropped 15% as warmer weather conditions continued across much of the U.S., resulting in a decline in residential and commercial sector use, the agency said. Power generation and industrial sector consumption also fell week-over-week.

Net withdrawals from storage amounted to 174 billion cubic feet for the week ended Jan. 31, resulting in total working gas stocks of 2,397 Bcf, the EIA reported. This was 111 Bcf lower than the five-year average and 208 Bcf lower than the year-ago period.

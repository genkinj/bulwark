Canopy Growth Corporation, a leading cannabis company, has released its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ending December 31,Â 2024. The report highlights significant financial and operational achievements, despite some challenges in the market.

**Financial Highlights**

For the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, Canopy Growth reported a net revenue of $74.8 million, a 5% decrease compared to the same period last year. However, excluding revenue from divested businesses, net revenue increased by 8%. The gross margin decreased by 400 basis points to 32%, primarily due to costs associated with the launch of Claybourne infused pre-rolls in Canada and increased indirect costs for Storz & Bickel vaporizer devices.

The company reported a net loss from continuing operations of $121.9 million, a 47% improvement year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $3.5 million, representing a 61% improvement from the previous year, driven by cost-saving measures. Free cash flow was an outflow of $28.2 million, a 17% improvement compared to the same period last year.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Canopy Growth saw a 19% year-over-year increase in net revenue for Storz & Bickel, driven by strong holiday sales and robust direct-to-consumer online sales. The company also reported a record quarter for Canada medical cannabis, with net revenue increasing by 16%. International markets saw a 14% increase in cannabis net revenue, with notable growth in Poland and Germany.

The company successfully launched Claybourne infused pre-rolls across Canada, achieving the #3 market share in the infused pre-roll category in British Columbia and Ontario within six weeks of launch.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

During the quarter, Canopy Growth reduced its total debt from $554 million to $442 million through an early prepayment of its senior secured term loan. The company also completed the acquisition of Acreage Holdings, Inc. by Canopy USA, LLC, and began integrating Mountain High Products, LLC, Wana Wellness, LLC, The Cima Group, LLC, Lemurian, Inc., and Acreage, generating cost savings.

In January 2025, Canopy USA appointed Brooks Jorgensen as President, bringing his extensive experience in high-growth industries, including cannabis, wine, and spirits.

**Management's Perspective**

Luc Mongeau, Chief Executive Officer, emphasized the company's focus on achieving sustainable profitability and creating value in key markets. Judy Hong, Chief Financial Officer, highlighted the company's best Adjusted EBITDA to date, driven by strong top-line growth in medical cannabis and Storz & Bickel, along with continued cost discipline.

**Future Outlook**

Canopy Growth remains optimistic about its future, focusing on expanding its product portfolio and market presence. The company aims to capitalize on growth opportunities in the U.S. cannabis sector through Canopy USA and continue its cost-saving initiatives to improve financial performance.

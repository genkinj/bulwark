There was little to disappoint in Canada's January jobs numbers, with employment rising a much stronger-than-expected 76,000 and total hours worked climbing 0.9% on-month, which bodes well for 1Q GDP, Capital Economics' Thomas Ryan says. The economist says the details of the labor survey also were encouraging, with a solid rise in private-sector employment driving most of the gains. A smaller increase in the population for the month is another sign the government's new immigration policies are having an effect, he adds. Ryan says that overall it lowers the odds the Bank of Canada will again cut rates in March, though with tariffs still looming he expects the bank to err on the dovish side and reduce the policy rate a further quarter percentage point.

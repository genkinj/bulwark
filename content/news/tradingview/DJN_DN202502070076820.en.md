Job creation in Canada has picked up strongly, with the 3-month average of 70,000 the fastest pace in almost two years, says TD Securities. January's jobs data indicates hiring in the goods-producing sector was the best one-month performance since 2006, when the pandemic era is excluded. Hiring was powered by manufacturing, and the firm acknowledges some of the job gains at factories was likely tied to ramped up production stemming from the risk of hefty US tariffs. TD believes a Bank of Canada rate cut is still in order for March, but the economy would have to materially slow to justify further rate cuts in 2Q. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

Norske Skog agreed to sell its Boyer mill in the Australian island state of Tasmania to Boyer Capital at an enterprise value of 190 million Norwegian kroner.

The sale of the mill, which can produce 150,000 tonnes of newsprint and 135,000 tonnes of magazine paper, marks the Norwegian pulp and paper company's exit from Australasia, according to a Friday release.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter.

Kimco Realty, a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in high-quality, open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use properties in the United States, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31,Â 2024. The company achieved the high end of its full-year outlook, driven by robust growth in net income and funds from operations (FFO).

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Kimco reported net income available to common shareholders of $154.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $133.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the same period of 2023. Full-year net income was $375.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, down from $629.3 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $194.1 million special cash dividend received from Albertsons Companies Inc. in 2023.

FFO for the fourth quarter was $286.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, up 7.7% from $239.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the full year, FFO was $1.1 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share, representing a 5.1% year-over-year growth.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Kimco's operational performance was strong, with the company leasing over 11 million square feet in 2024. The fourth quarter saw the signing of 429 leases totaling 2.4 million square feet, with new leases generating a 35.4% increase in pro-rata cash rent spreads. The company's pro-rata portfolio occupancy ended the quarter at 96.3%, with anchor occupancy at 98.2%.

Notable acquisitions included the purchase of Waterford Lakes Town Center in Orlando, Florida, for $322 million and Markets at Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida, for $108 million. These acquisitions are expected to enhance the company's portfolio of high-quality, grocery-anchored centers.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

During the fourth quarter, Kimco raised $136.3 million from the sale of 5.4 million shares of common stock through its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. The company also completed a cash tender for 409,772 depositary shares of its 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, incurring a charge of $3.3 million.

Kimco ended the year with approximately $2.7 billion in immediate liquidity, including full availability on its $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $689.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. In January 2025, Moody's affirmed the company's Baa1 senior unsecured rating and changed its outlook to positive.

**Management's Perspective**

Kimco CEO Conor Flynn commented, "Our fourth quarter and full-year results capped another remarkable year for Kimco, as we reached the high end of our 2024 outlook, driven by the successful integration of the RPT acquisition and strong leasing results that led to significant growth in net operating income and FFO. We remain well-positioned to sustain our strong operating performance with our portfolio of high-quality, grocery-anchored centers that provide essential goods and services in core markets with high barriers to entry and limited new supply."

**Future Outlook**

For 2025, Kimco has provided an initial outlook, projecting net income per diluted share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.72 and FFO per diluted share to be between $1.70 and $1.72. The company expects Same Property Net Operating Income (NOI) growth of 2.0% or more and plans to invest $100 million to $125 million in acquisitions, including structured investments.

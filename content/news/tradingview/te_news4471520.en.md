The DAX ticked down toward 21,880 on Friday afternoon, just below recent record highs, as traders assessed the latest US jobs report that still indicated a robust labor market.

Payroll growth missed expectations, while the unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped to 4%, and wage growth accelerated to 0.5%, exceeding forecasts.

On the domestic data front, German industrial production dropped more than expected at the end of 2024, notching its largest decline in five months.

Among single stocks, Porsche AGâ€™s shares plunged nearly 6% after announcing impairments and 2025 sales guidance below forecasts.

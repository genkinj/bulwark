Amazon.com has agreed to pay $3.95 million to the District of Columbia to resolve a lawsuit alleging the company stole tips intended for delivery workers, Attorney General Brian Schwalb said Friday.

In 2022, the Office of the Attorney General sued Amazon, claiming the company misled customers into thinking their tips would go to Amazon Flex delivery drivers, but instead, most of the tips were used to lower Amazon's labor costs and boost profits.

After previous legal action, Amazon drivers were already reimbursed for lost wages. The retailer, along with Amazon Logistics, will now pay $2.45 million in penalties and $1.5 million to cover costs. Amazon is also required to be transparent about its tipping practices by clearly stating how the tips are being used on both its website and app, Schwalb said.

Amazon did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' request for comment.

Shares of the company were down 3.9% in recent trading.

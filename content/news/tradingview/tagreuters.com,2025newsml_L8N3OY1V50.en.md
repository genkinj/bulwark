Amazon's video streaming services in Germany were thrown into doubt on Friday when a German court ruled that the U.S. technology giant was violating a patent owned by Finnish network equipment maker Nokia .

The regional court in the western city of Duesseldorf said it ruled that Amazon could no longer continue its streaming services in its current technical form in the country, or else face fines of 250,000 euros ($259,000) for "every case of violation".

Weekly magazine WirtschaftsWoche earlier reported the ruling.

Nokia, which had brought the legal challenge through its Alcatel-Lucent business, was not immediately available for comment.

Amazon representatives in Germany were not immediately available for comment.

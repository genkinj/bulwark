HOUSTON, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Prairie Operating Co. (the “Company,” “Prairie,” “we,” “our” or “us”), today announced it has entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to acquire (the “Bayswater Acquisition”) certain assets (the “Bayswater Assets”) from Bayswater Exploration and Production and certain of its affiliated entities (collectively “Bayswater”), a premier operator in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (the “DJ Basin”).   The transaction will significantly increase the Company’s operational scale and footprint in the DJ Basin and add highly economic drilling locations.

The purchase price of the acquisition is $602.75 million. The transaction consideration will consist of cash and up to ~5.2 million shares of Prairie common stock. Prairie anticipates funding the cash portion of the consideration, net of expected purchase price adjustments, through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s credit facility, pursuant to which the Company has received commitments to expand its borrowing base to $475 million as of the closing of the Bayswater Acquisition, and proceeds from one or more capital markets transactions, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company expects to complete the Bayswater Acquisition in February 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, with an economic effective date of December 1, 2024.

“This acquisition delivers compelling strategic and financial advantages and reflects our disciplined, but opportunistic approach to rapidly expand our footprint in the DJ Basin,” said Edward Kovalik, Chairman and CEO of Prairie Operating Co. “Not only will the addition of these high-quality assets be immediately accretive, but they will also accelerate our development plans, enhance operational efficiencies, and drive sustainable, long-term value creation for our shareholders.”

Gary Hanna, President of the Company, added, “This acquisition represents a transformative milestone for Prairie Operating Co. by significantly expanding our footprint and production of oil rich assets in the DJ Basin. Upon closing, we will be well-positioned to deliver significant organic production growth in 2025 and beyond.”

Key Prairie Highlights, Pro Forma for the Transaction:

* Transformational Increase in Oil-Weighted Production: ~27,500 net BOEPD (69% liquids)
* **Expanded Footprint / Inventory Life**: ~54,000 net acres, including ~600 highly economic drilling locations, providing ~10 years of drilling inventory
* **Significantly Increases Free Cash Flow:** Expected to be immediately accretive to per-share cash flow metrics
* **Maintains Strong Balance Sheet:** Expected leverage ratio of ~1.0x at closing with upsized committed credit facility and ample liquidity
* **Meaningful Infrastructure Synergies**: Leverages existing infrastructure to drive operational efficiencies and reduce development costs
* **Attractive Valuation Metrics****(****1****)**: PV-20 of Proved Developed Producing (“PDP”) reserves and $23,500 per net flowing BOE

**2025 Updated Guidance**

Upon the closing of this acquisition, the combined Company’s 2025 pro forma outlook includes:

* **Average Daily Production:** 29,000 – 31,000 BOEPD
* **Capital Expenditures (Capex):** $300 million – $320 million

**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures**

*Adjusted EBITDA*

This press release also contains Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate the performance of our business, make operational decisions, and assess our ability to generate cashflows.  Management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with helpful information to better understand the underlying performance trends of our business, facilitate period-to-period comparisons, and assess the company’s operating results.

Adjusted EBITDA is derived from Net income and is adjusted for income tax expense, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A), accretion of asset retirement obligations, non-cash stock-based compensation, and loss on unrealized commodity derivatives. We adjust net income for the items listed above to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially between periods and companies within our industry depending upon accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired. Additionally, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA does not imply that our operating results will not be affected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, including that it excludes certain items that affect our reported financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, GAAP Net income or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Additionally, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (in Millions)

This press release contains PV-10, which is a financial measure not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. PV-10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (“Standardized Measure”), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for proved reserves. PV-10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre-tax basis. PV-10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes discounted at 10%. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of the applicable crude oil, natural gas and NGLs properties. We believe that the presentation of PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure, or after-tax amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our reserves before considering future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, PV-10 is based on prices and discount factors that are consistent for all companies.

The following table reconciles PV-10 to the standard measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure:

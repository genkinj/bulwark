Savannah Resources said Friday it temporarily paused its fieldwork on the land it does not own under its Barroso lithium project in Portugal in compliance with Portuguese law.

The move followed a "precautionary measure" filed by three local landowners at the Administrative and Fiscal Court of Mirandela, which questioned the Portuguese Ministry of Environment and Energy's approved temporary land easement order in December 2024 for the lithium development company.

Savannah noted that it was allowed to continue fieldwork on land it owns or has rights to access. It added that it will submit its own claim to the court and expects to resume its operations at the concerned land soon.

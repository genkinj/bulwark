XL Media secured commitments to repurchase 121,545,490 of its ordinary shares under a tender offer launched on Jan. 20.

The validly tendered shares represent 46.3% of the British sports and gaming digital media group's issued capital and 87.4% of the total number offered, according to a Friday release. Payments to shareholders are expected on Feb. 17.

XLMedia launched the tender to return cash to shareholders following asset sales in Europe and North America, with plans to make a further distribution in the second quarter.

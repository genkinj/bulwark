Amazon.com reported "healthy" Q4 earnings, with operating income beating expectations by 11%, but issued weaker-than-expected Q1 guidance due to foreign exchange headwinds and capacity constraints, Wedbush said in a note Friday.

The brokerage said it believes the guidance is conservative, as Amazon has exceeded the high end of its operating income forecasts over the past eight quarters and a number of potential catalysts are expected to drive operating income in the intermediate term, including AI-driven AWS growth, improved automation, commercialization of Alexa AI capabilities, Project Kuiper monetization, and a potential Prime subscription price increase.

Looking ahead, Amazon's long-term profitability is expected to benefit from fulfillment optimization, higher-margin advertising, and Amazon Web Services expansion. However, near-term profit beats may be smaller due to increased investments in artificial intelligence initiatives and Project Kuiper, Wedbush said.

Amazon expects Q1 revenue of $151 billion to $155.5 billion and operating income of $14 billion to $18 billion, both below consensus, Wedbush said, adding that it has lowered Amazon's Q1 and 2025 revenue estimates by 2.4% and 1.6%, respectively, due to FX headwinds and Q1 guidance.

Wedbush maintained an outperform rating on Amazon, with a $280 price target.

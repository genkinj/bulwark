STOCKS:

The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 0.25% to 77,860.19, while the broader NSE Nifty 50 index declined 0.18% to 23,559.95, as a widely expected interest rate cut failed to excite investors who were expecting more measures from the central bank to boost liquidity.

RUPEE:

The Indian rupee rose 0.17% versus the U.S. dollar to 87.4250, after struggling for most of the week as global markets were jolted by fears of a trade war and foreign portfolio outflows persisted, pushing the rupee to its lifetime low past the 87 handle.

GOVERNMENT BONDS:

The benchmark 10-year bond (IN067934G=CC) was quoted at 100.59 rupees, with the yield jumping about 5 bps at 6.7043%, after the Reserve Bank of India did not announce any other steps to accompany its first rate cut in nearly five years, which was largely factored into bond prices.

OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAPS:

The one-year overnight index swap rate (INR1YMIBROIS=CC) was up over 3 basis points at 6.35%, while the five-year swap rate (INR5YMIBROIS=CC) jumped 5 bps to 6.1175%.

CALL MONEY:

India's overnight call money rate (INROND=) was at 5.75% and the overnight TREPS rate (INTREPTOT=TCCL) was at 6.25%.

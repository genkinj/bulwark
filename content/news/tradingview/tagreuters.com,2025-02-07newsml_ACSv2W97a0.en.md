**TORONTO, ON / ACCESS Newswire / February 7, 2025 /** Redishred Capital Corp. ("**Redishred**" or the "**Corporation**") is pleased to announce today that it has completed its previously announced statutory plan of arrangement pursuant to the *Canada Business Corporations Act* (the "**Arrangement**"). Pursuant to the Arrangement, a subsidiary of VRC Companies, LLC has acquired all of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (the "**Shares**") of Redishred (the "**Transaction**") in an all cash transaction for CA$5.00 per Share.

A detailed description of the Arrangement is set forth in Redishred's management information circular dated December 20, 2024. Shareholders can obtain a copy of the circular as filed with applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com.

It is anticipated that the Shares will be de-listed from the TSX Venture Exchange (the "**TSX-V**") as of the close of trading on or about February 10, 2025. Redishred will apply to the Canadian securities regulators for it to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable Canadian securities laws.

The majority of Redishred Shares are held through brokers and other intermediaries, and beneficial holders of those Shares will not need to take any further action in order to receive the cash consideration under the Arrangement. Registered shareholders of Redishred must submit their share certificates or direct registration statements (as applicable) along with a duly completed letter of transmittal in order to receive the cash consideration under the Arrangement. A letter of transmittal was mailed to all registered shareholders and is also available under Redishred's issuer profile at www.sedarplus.com.

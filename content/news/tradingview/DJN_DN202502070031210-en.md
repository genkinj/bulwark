By Sherry Qin

Taiwan's first set of inflation and trade data for 2025 showed that price pressures picked up in the first month of the year, while exports growth cooled far more than expected.

The island economy's consumer prices rose 2.66% in January, staying above the key 2% threshold for a third consecutive month. Stickiness in inflation could see the central bank remain as one of the few in the region that has yet to start cutting interest rates.

The data could be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which fell in January this year, DBS economists said ahead of the results, noting that goods and services prices were notably higher during the holiday.

The economists expect Taiwan's inflation to remain stable on the back of weak oil prices and a cooling property market. That said, they see risks from cuts to the 2025 budget, including subsidies for state-owned Taipower, which could lead to higher electricity prices and fuel inflation expectations.

Separate data on Friday showed that Taiwan's exports rose 4.4% last month, far below the 8.7% expected in a Wall Street Journal poll and the 9.2% rise seen in December. Exports of electronic products grew at a slower pace while shipments of base metals, machinery and plastics and rubber fell on the year.

January's imports slid 17.2%, putting the trade surplus at $9.97 billion.

Economists believe that demand for artificial intelligence, along with some front-loading of shipments, should continue to support Taiwan's exports in the near term. But though Taiwan has not been directly targeted by Trump tariffs yet, they remain a risk for the island economy.

Taiwan's $48 billion surplus with the U.S. means that, on paper, it should be in Washington's crosshairs, Moody's Analytics economists said in a recent note.

Investment and security ties could help Taiwan dodge the tariffs bullet but its export-reliant economy will still feel the heat from a wider trade war, Stefan Angrick, Jeemin Bang and Dave Chia said.

Taiwanese chip and electronics producers operating in the U.S. could face disruptions either through direct trade barriers or skyrocketing production costs, they noted.

"The trade war is only just beginning, and Northeast Asia's developed economies may soon find themselves caught in the crossfire," they added.

At least, Taiwan's economy faces the headwinds from a position of relative strength, having clocked 4.3% gross domestic product growth last year, topping official forecasts and marking a big jump from the expansion seen in 2023.

The chip-making powerhouse, home to semiconductor giant TSMC, has also continued to benefit from the AI boom, but whether that proves to be a similar advantage this year remains to be seen.

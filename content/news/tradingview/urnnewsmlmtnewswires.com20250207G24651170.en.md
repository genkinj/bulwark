Fitch Ratings has maintained South Korea's AA- long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating with a stable outlook, citing the country's healthy external finances, stable macroeconomic position, and vital export sector.

However, geopolitical risks from North Korea, challenges from an aging population, and recent political uncertainty pose ongoing risks, Fitch said in a Thursday release.

The rating agency lowered its 2025 GDP forecast for the country to 1.7% due to political issues and weak data, with a gradual recovery expected later in the year.

Medium-term growth could hit 2.1%, with demographic headwinds and global competition serving as constraints.

Fitch expects the country's deficit to narrow to 1% of GDP in 2025 and government debt to rise to 48.4% of GDP this year.

Notable shifts in the country's government debt-to-GDP ratio, lingering political tensions, and geopolitical risks could trigger future rating actions, Fitch said.

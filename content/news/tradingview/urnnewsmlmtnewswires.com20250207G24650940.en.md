AlphaValue/Baader Europe reiterated its positive stance on GSK as it welcomed the pharmaceutical giant's latest earnings report.

Adding that its model on the company is under review, analysts kept their buy rating on the British stock with a price target of 21.71 pounds sterling on Thursday.

Analysts said their upbeat outlook on the company is supported by a number of medium-to-long-term factors such as GSK's foothold on the HIV vaccine market, non-vaccine-related growth and robust cash generation and balance sheet.

"The Q4 results exceeded the street's expectations, while the 2025 outlook was in line with consensus estimates," the note said. "We see a material upside in GSK's shares, backed by its dominant position in HIV and vaccines, strong momentum in other areas, encouraging pipeline potential and a healthy balance sheet."

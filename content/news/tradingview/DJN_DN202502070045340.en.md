By Katy Barnato

After this week's tariff drama and earnings blitz, it's Jobs Day.

The monthly report, a key gauge for the Federal Reserve, is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. It will be the first to cover any time since President Trump's inauguration.

The U.S. likely added fewer positions in January than December, hit by the Los Angeles fires and by unusually cold weather in many parts of the country.

Economists expect payrolls expanded by 169,000 roles in January, and unemployment held steady at 4.1%.

Meantime, Amazon is in focus, after the e-retailer gave lower-than-expected guidance and said it plans record AI-related capital outlays this year. Shares slipped premarket.

In recent market action:

* U.S. stock futures held steady. Contracts tied to the Dow industrials, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 were muted.
* Chinese tech stocks entered a new bull market in Hong Kong, buoyed by the emergence of DeepSeek. PC maker Lenovo and smartphone specialist Xiaomi were among the big gainers.
* Treasurys were subdued. Benchmark 10-year yields edged higher, after settling Thursday at 4.437%.

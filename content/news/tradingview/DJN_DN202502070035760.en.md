Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Composite Index ended 0.4% higher at 1590.91. Gains were driven by buying in tech and construction stocks amid bargain hunting following a recent selloff, said Thong Pak Leng, vice president of equity research at Rakuten Trade. The KLCI is expected to trade between 1580 and 1600 next week, with focus on the construction, utilities and technology sectors, he said. Among gainers, YTL Power International added 6.5%, while Inari Amertron rose 12% amid better tech sentiment. Meanwhile, MISC Bhd. was 2.1% lower and Petronas Gas lost 1.8%. (yingxian.wong@wsj.com)

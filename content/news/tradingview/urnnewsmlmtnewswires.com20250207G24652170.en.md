The High Court of Justice in England and Wales on Friday sanctioned the scheme of arrangement relating to Fortress Investment-backed CF Exedra Bidco's planned takeover of Loungers plc .

The scheme is expected to take effect Feb. 11, with delisting of the British hospitality company's shares from the AIM segment of the London bourse to follow the next day.

In mid-January, CF Exedra offered 3.25 pounds sterling for each Loungers share, which valued the latter's entire share capital at 354.4 million pounds.

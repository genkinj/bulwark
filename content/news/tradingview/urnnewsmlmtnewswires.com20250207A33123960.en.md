Eli Lilly said Friday that data from its VIVID-2 open-label extension study showed bowel disease drug Omvoh, mirikizumab-mrkz, provided long-term clinical remission and endoscopic response to patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease as well as for those with prior biologic failure.

Eli Lilly said after two years of treatment, 92.9% of patients in clinical remission at one year remained in remission, while 87.6% maintained endoscopic response with visible healing of the intestinal lining. Of the patients in endoscopic remission at one year of treatment, 78.6% sustained endoscopic remission at two years.

According to the data, 60.8% of patients not in clinical remission at one year achieved remission in the second year. Of those patients not in endoscopic remission at one year, 35.4% gained remission in the second year, the company said.

Eli Lilly said 6.8% of patients with endoscopic response at one year reported a serious adverse event, while 0.8% decided to end the treatment due to an adverse event.

The results will be presented at the Crohn's and Colitis Congress from Feb. 6 to Feb. 8.

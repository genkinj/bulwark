Porsche AG shares were at the bottom of the DAX index midday Friday after the luxury carmaker estimated an 800 million-euro restructuring cost, which Deutsche Bank Research said was higher than expected by the market.

"While we directionally fully support P911's adjustments and have hoped for it for a while now, we do believe the required magnitude will be taken quite negative. We have argued before that a premium multiple requires premium execution and we see this as P911's last shot to prove they can turn around this business before losing more trust of long-term shareholders," analysts wrote on Friday.

The research firm lowered its group operating forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by 16% and 6%, respectively, to 4.52 billion euros and 5.59 billion euros. The stock remained at Buy with a price target of 70 euros.

"We highly appreciate that the company is willing to adapt to the new normal with ICE models playing a bigger role and volumes remaining depressed, especially in China," analysts said, adding that it expected a volatile 2025 for the company.

Around midday, the stock was nearly 5% in the red.

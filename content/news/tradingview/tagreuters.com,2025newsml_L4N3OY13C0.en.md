Exchange operator Cboe Global Markets reported a rise in fourth-quarter adjusted profit on Friday, driven by increased options trading as investors sought to hedge against risks from economic and geopolitical uncertainties.

Cboe's options trading segment revenue grew 3% in the quarter, compared with last year, while futures revenue fell 7%.

Heightened concerns about interest-rate cuts, a potential trade war and geopolitical tensions kept investors on edge despite a strong market rally, driving demand for hedging.

"While the robust options volumes were a standout for 2024, the results were notable in that each category, Derivatives Markets, Data Vantage, and Cash and Spot Markets, contributed to the fourth-quarter and full-year growth," CEO Fredric Tomczyk said.

S&P 500 index options ADVs increased 7%, while ADV of options linked to the VIX Volatility Index , Wall Street's "fear gauge", rose 12% from a year earlier.

Average daily volumes in total company options increased to 15.7 million contracts in the reported quarter from 14.9 million a year earlier.

Demand for options contracts opened on the same day they expire, or 0DTE (zero-days-to-expiry), rose 6% from a year earlier.

On an adjusted basis, the exchange operator's net income allocated to common shareholders came in at $221.2 million, or $2.10 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with $218.8 million, or $2.06 per share, in the year-ago period.

Cboe's fourth-quarter net revenue rose 5% to $524.5 million from a year earlier, while revenue from North America equities rose 10% to $94.9 million.

Most brokerages continue to expect a slower pace of interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2025 ahead of a non-farm payrolls (NFP) report due today amid uncertainty from President Donald Trump's tariff policy.

President Trump's tariff policy is expected to drive up inflation and will increase pressure on the U.S. central bank as it looks to control persistent inflationary pressures.

The Federal Reserve left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range in its January policy meeting and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate.

Here are the forecasts from major brokerages in 2025:

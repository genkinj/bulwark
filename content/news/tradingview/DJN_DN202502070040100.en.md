Amazon.com continues to innovate and raise the bar even as 4Q cloud-computing sales and the tech company's outlook for 1Q came below analysts' expectations, AJ Bell's Dan Coatsworth writes in a research note. "Fundamentally, Amazon remains in great shape," he says. The group can afford to try new things and even fail with some experiments because it generates significant cash flow, Coatsworth notes. This strength should be recognized by investors, he adds. Amazon shares are down 2.7% premarket at $232.33. (mauro.orru@wsj.com)

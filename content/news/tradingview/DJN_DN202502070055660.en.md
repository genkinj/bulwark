The loss of M&S's clothing, home and beauty boss Richard Price is a massive blow to the retailer, having done such a good job in recent years, AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould writes. He adds that the appointment of former Boohoo CEO John Lyttle might seem an odd choice given his background with value retailers, which goes against M&S's model. "Lyttle will have big shoes to fill and for once, investors might hope that he doesn't try and bring a flavor of former employers to his new role," Mould writes. M&S shares are down 2.35% at 345.0 pence while the FTSE 100 index is 0.3% lower. (ian.walker@wsj.com.)

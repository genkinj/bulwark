Every industry relies on government facts and figures, some of which Donald Trump is purging. Heavy users generated $750 bln of revenue in 2022, growing their share of GDP by 50% in a decade. If official information is less available or trusted, expect more garbage in – and out.

CONTEXT NEWS

A unit of Harvard University’s Law Library said on February 6 that it was releasing an archive of 311,000 government data sets harvested in 2024 and 2025, aiming to protect public information at a time when President Donald Trump’s administration is removing some of it from official websites.

Democrats on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Accountability on February 7 called for an investigation into possible national security breaches and privacy violations posed by the Department of Government Efficiency, a quasi-governmental organization run by Elon Musk that aims to cut federal spending.

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations sued on February 5 to block DOGE’s access to the Labor Department’s information systems. The union claimed that access would give Musk information about investigations into his company and threaten the independence and autonomy of the DOL’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.

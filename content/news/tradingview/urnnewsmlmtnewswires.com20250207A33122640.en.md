European bourses were muted midday Friday as traders digested the maturing earnings season and awaited fresh catalysts, including the pending US January jobs report.

Oil stocks forged higher, while property issues lagged.

Investors also eyed flat Wall Street futures and choppy closes overnight on Asian exchanges.

In economic news, the National Statistics Institute (INE) reported that Spain's industrial production index rose 2.1% year over year in December.

The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 Index was off 0.1% mid-session.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Technology Index was off 0.2%, and the Stoxx 600 Banks Index was flat.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Oil and Gas Index was up 0.5%, and the Stoxx 600 Europe Food and Beverage Index inclined 0.1%.

The REITE, a European REIT index, fell 0.5%, and the Stoxx Europe 600 Retail Index declined 0.2%.

On the national market indexes, Germany's DAX was up 0.1%, and the FTSE 100 in London was down 0.3%. The CAC 40 in Paris was flat, and Spain's IBEX 35 lost 0.2%.

Yields on benchmark 10-year German bonds were lower, near 2.36%.

Front-month North Sea Brent crude oil futures were up 0.5% to $74.69 per barrel.

The Euro Stoxx 50 volatility index was down 0.8% to 15.87, indicating below-average volatility for European stock markets in the next 30 days, a positive signal. A reading above 20 indicates choppier markets ahead, while below 20 suggests calmer exchanges.

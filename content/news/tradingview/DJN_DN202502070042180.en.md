Legal & General Group's U.S. insurance businesses sale makes strategic sense and the subsequent capital returns boost management's credibility after disappointing returns from the Cala sale, BofA Securities analysts write. L&G plans to return 1.0 billion pounds of the funds to shareholders via buybacks upon completion of the deal. The analysts say they already expected a 500 million pound buyback in this year and now see scope for about 1.2 billion next year. Shares are up 5.5% at 252.0 pence and are leading the FTSE 100-index gainers.(ian.walker@wsj.com.)

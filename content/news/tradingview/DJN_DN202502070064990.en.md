OTTAWA--Canadian stocks of wheat, corn and soybeans were up as of the end of last year, but canola stocks were down

Total wheat stocks rose 0.9% on a year earlier to 24.5 million metric tons as of Dec., 31, Statistics Canada said Friday.

The increase was thanks largely to a 6.1% increase in production to 35.0 million metric tons.

On-farm stocks were 3.4% higher at 20.9 million tons, which offset a 11.7% fall in commercial stocks to 3.5 million tons, the data agency said.

Deliveries of wheat off farm fell 0.4% to 15.3 million tons, while wheat exports increased 0.9% to 10.8 million tons and remained above the five-year average for the period as demand for Canadian wheat remained strong.

Canadian stocks of canola were 19.2% lower year-over-year to 11.4 million tons, which the agency said reflected a 23.5% decline in on-farm stocks to 9.9 million tons. Canola exports reached the highest for the period since 2000, climbing 80.8% on-year to 4.4 million tons as of end-December.

Total stocks of corn for grain were up 0.2% at 11.3 million tons as of the end of December. Imports of corn for grain fell 52.0% for the period.

Soybean stocks rose 10.9% to 4.2 million tons. On-farm stocks increased 34.3%, while commercial stocks fell 18.0%.

\*\* Shares of cement producer Titan America (TTAM.N) set to open up to 12.5% above their offer price in their New York Stock Exchange debut

\*\* Stock indicated to open in the range of $16 to $18 vs $16 IPO price

\*\* TTAM, along with its parent Titan Cement International , raised $384 mln by selling 24 mln shares within the marketed range of $15 to $18

\*\* At the IPO price, TTAM was valued at $2.95 bln

\*\* Listing comes as a wave of companies look to go public in New York before the IPO market hits the seasonal February lull

\*\* Q3 financial statements go stale, or become too old to be used in a prospectus, on Feb. 14, needing issuers to finalize audited year-end numbers before they can go public

\*\* TTAM supplies heavy building materials and services in the eastern region of the United States

\*\* Citigroup and Goldman Sachs were the lead underwriters

\*\* TTAM plans to use the IPO proceeds for capex expenditures and other purposes, including technology investments and potential acquisitions

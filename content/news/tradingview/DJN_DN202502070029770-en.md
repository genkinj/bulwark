Mega Lifesciences' 2025 business outlook appears mixed, CGS International's Thanapol Jiratanakij says in a research report as the brokerage maintains the stock's hold rating. Its branded revenue is projected to grow 6.6% this year thanks to robust demand for its nutraceutical products and increased contribution from its newly launched pharmaceutical formulations, the analyst says. However, the brokerage foresees ongoing challenges for the Thai pharmaceutical company in Myanmar, where the government continues to impose import curbs on various goods including pharmaceutical products. The brokerage cuts the stock's target price to THB34.00 from THB40.50 to partly reflect ongoing risks in Myanmar owing to political uncertainty. Shares are 4.2% higher at THB31.25.

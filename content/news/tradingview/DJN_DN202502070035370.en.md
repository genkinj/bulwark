By Ying Xian Wong

Malaysia has launched an antidumping investigation into galvanized steel imports from China, South Korea and Vietnam.

The probe follows a petition from Malaysian producer CSC Steel in January. CSC alleged that imports of flat-rolled iron and steel products coated with zinc were being sold at prices much lower than in their home markets, hurting the country's domestic industry, the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry said in a statement released Friday.

The ministry said it will assess the claims and gather input from importers, exporters, trade associations and government officials from the named countries.

A preliminary decision on potential antidumping duties is expected within 120 days, the ministry said.

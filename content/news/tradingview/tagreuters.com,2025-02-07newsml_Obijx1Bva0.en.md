As previously communicated, the Company and its board are in the process ofidentifying strategic alternatives for the Company. These processes areprogressing well, and it may involve a sale of assets or shares in CondAlign.While the market traction is strong and the strategic discussions arepositive,the Company needs to secure funding to finance the current business and thesestrategic discussions. With this background the Company has resolved to explore a potential capitalraise through the issuance of a convertible loan to raise gross proceeds ofminimum NOK 9 million and maximum NOK 15 million. If the minimum proceeds areraised the Company expects the current cash runway to be extended to May 2025,which is expected to give ample time to continue but not necessarily concludethe ongoing strategic process.

The convertible loan can be converted into units of shares in the existingshareclasses of preference shares and ordinary shares at a conversion price of NOK8per unit. Each unit includes 1 preference share and 50 ordinary shares.

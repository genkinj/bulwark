The US economy is expected to add 170K jobs in January 2025, marking the slowest pace in three months and down from the 256K added in December.

Job growth was likely affected by wildfires in Los Angeles and harsh winter conditions.

The unemployment rate is projected to hold steady at 4.1%, while wages are forecast to rise 0.3% month-over-month, matching December's increase, bringing annual wage growth slightly down to 3.8%.

This report will also include annual benchmark revisions, which could significantly alter previous employment figures.

In August, the BLS' preliminary revision showed that US job growth for the year ending in March 2024 was weaker than initially reported, with 818K fewer jobs added, the largest downward revision since 2009.

In 2024, payroll employment increased by 2.2 million, averaging 186K jobs per month, compared to 3.0 million in 2023, which had an average monthly gain of 251K. Despite the slowdown, the data continues to reflect a resilient labor market.

Amazon expects capital expenditures to exceed $100 billion in 2025, Chief Executive Andy Jassy said Thursday during an earnings call.

The company spent $26.3 billion in capex in Q4, it believes this to be representative of how much spending can be expected in 2025, Jassy said.

The majority of the spending will be directed toward the development of artificial intelligence, particularly for its Amazon Web Services unit, which requires significant investment in data centers, hardware, and networking equipment, according to the company.

The reason for this increased investment is the company's belief that AI will transform nearly every application and is a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Jassy said.

The shares of the company were down more than 3% in recent Friday premarket activity.

Chicago wheat, corn and soybean futures ticked down on Friday, consolidating near multi-month highs as traders awaited U.S. jobs data while continuing to monitor global crop weather and U.S. trade policy.

The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was down 0.5% at $5.84-3/4 a bushel at 1204 GMT, after earlier reaching a 3-1/2 month high at $5.92-1/2.

CBOT corn was off 0.6% at $4.92-1/2 a bushel, but still close to Wednesday's 15-month peak of $4.98-1/2. Soybeans edged down 0.5% to $10.55-1/4 a bushel, also holding near Wednesday's six-month peak of $10.79-3/4.

The dollar index and U.S. stock futures were steady as investors braced for the monthly U.S. jobs data later in the day.

The figures, one of the most closely-watched economic indicators, can trigger movements in the dollar, influencing dollar-priced commodities such as Chicago grains.

Financial markets were also watching for further pointers on U.S. President Donald Trump's trade initiatives after proposed tariffs against Canada and Mexico were delayed, while levies against China drew a measured response from Beijing.

Grain markets also remained sensitive to weather news for corn and soy crops in South America as well as wheat across the northern hemisphere.

While the return of rain to some parched Argentine crop belts has helped cap corn and soybean prices since mid-week, forecasts of colder weather in Russia has rekindled concern about weak early development for wheat plants there.

"There's growing certainty about poorer conditions for the Russian crop this year," said Commonwealth Bank analyst Dennis Voznesenski.

"The big driver of global wheat markets in the last couple of years has been exports out of the Black Sea. If the market is getting more confident of a smaller crop in Russia this year, that's very significant."

A large short position held by investment funds has left the wheat market prone to bursts of short-covering, according to analysts.

Wheat prices were also being underpinned by slowing shipments from Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter, as supplies ebb and the authorities implement an export quota.

Grain traders are starting to turn their attention towards monthly supply-demand report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture next Tuesday.

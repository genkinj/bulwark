0736 GMT - U.S. tariffs are likely to have a wide-ranging impact on multiple assets, according to Benoit Anne, managing director at MFS Investment Management, in a commentary. Global equities have not yet factored in significant policy risks, anticipating negative implications from tariffs on stock prices, Anne notes. In terms of fixed income, the latest development is likely to further reduce the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to ease policy going forward, given the potential one-off adjustment effect on U.S. domestic prices, Anne adds. Furthermore, Canadian energy producers and Midwest refiners are likely to face challenges due to tariffs, Anne says. Legal uncertainties, potential extensions to other regions, and government negotiations are also closely watched, Anne notes. (tracy.qu@wsj.com)

0732 GMT - A rise in German exports at the end of last year suggests a rush to trade ahead of looming tariffs and doesn't promise a rebound in the country's manufacturing, Carsten Brzeski at Dutch bank ING tells investors in a note. Exports from Europe's largest economy unexpectedly rose in December, figures show Friday. That is likely to be a result of front-loading ahead of the tariffs that U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose on goods imported from the EU, Brzeski says. Combined with separate data showing a slump in production, the structural weakness in the German economy, he says. "Industry has been and will remain a drag on German growth," Brzeski warns.

0720 GMT - The FTSE 100 is expected to open 22 points, or 0.3%, lower according to IG. The index closed 103 points, or 1.2%, higher to 8727 points Thursday. The Bank of England cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.5% Thursday, as expected. However, two members surprised the market by voting for a 50bp cut, weakening sterling and boosting the FTSE 100. Turning to Friday's agenda, the focus is on the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report at 1330 GMT as it could provide clues about the Federal Reserve's rate path. "We think that the employment picture will start to weaken from the second quarter, but for now will remain strong," Jefferies economist Mohit Kumar says in a note. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0710 GMT - China's consumer price index likely rose 0.4% on year in January, picking up from December's 0.1% increase on higher food demand around the Lunar New Year holiday, according to a poll of 11 economists by The Wall Street Journal. Food prices were likely driven by increased demand before and during the holiday, while some service prices also likely rose, economists say. The decline in China's factory-gate prices likely eased to 2.2% on year in January, improving from December's 2.3% drop, according to the poll. China's National Bureau of Statistics is due to release the data on Sunday.(singaporeeditors@dowjones.com)

0658 GMT - It is tough to imagine the U.S. jobs report being a game-changer from a Federal Reserve policy perspective, says Michael Brown of Pepperstone in a note. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has noted that policymakers need to see either 'real' inflation progress or 'some' labor market weakness in order to unlock another rate cut, the senior research strategist says. For markets, the jobs report is likely to be a case of 'good news is good news,' or vice versa, with a focus on the underlying economic story rather than any potential policy implications, Brown says. Economists' consensus forecast for January job additions is 169,000, according to The Wall Street Journal's poll. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0648 GMT - Japanese stocks ended lower as concerns about higher borrowing costs persisted. Auto and real-estate stocks led the declines. Toyota Motor dropped 2.7% and Sumitomo Realty & Development shed 2.8%. The Nikkei Stock Average fell 0.7% to 38787.02. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield rose 4 basis points to 1.300%, the highest level since April 2011. Investors are paying attention to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's U.S. visit. USD/JPY is at 151.71, compared with 151.45 as of Thursday 5 p.m. Eastern time. (kosaku.narioka@wsj.com; @kosakunarioka)

0647 GMT - If U.S. nonfarm payrolls data at 1330 GMT prompts a selloff in Treasurys, investors could consider this as a buying opportunity, Societe Generale Research's rates strategists say in a note. "We are neutral on duration, but view a selloff post NFP as a buying opportunity," they say. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield broke below the tight 4.50%-4.65% range in response to weaker data and unchanged forward guidance in the Treasury's refunding announcement, they note. Nevertheless, the risks to yields are skewed to the downside in case of a below-consensus print, they say. Economists in The Wall Street Journal's poll forecast 169,000 jobs were added in January versus 256,000 in December. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rises 1 basis point to 4.446%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0643 GMT - The Indian central bank's rate cut could deliver a boost to homebuying sentiment, says Kaushal Agarwal, co-founder and director at The Guardians Real Estate Advisory. The move is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially making home loans more affordable, Agarwal says in a note. For developers, the cut could ease financial strain and encourage new projects, he adds. The RBI's inflation and GDP growth projections indicate a stable economic outlook, which may contribute to a more balanced environment for the real-estate sector, supporting demand in both residential and commercial segments, he says.(fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)

0638 GMT - The Bank of Japan is behind the curve and needs to get to neutral, between 1% and 1.5%, over the coming year, RBC BlueBay Asset Management's Kaspar Hense says in a note. "That should drag the entire curve higher, but in particular the 10-year part of the curve, which is currently artificially dragged down by Rinban purchases," the senior portfolio manager says. However, those purchases of JGBs will be reduced from July onward, he says. "That being said, we do think the 30-year part of the curve is approaching fairer value at around 2.5%." The 10-year JGB yield rises 4 basis points to 1.304%, while the 30-year is up 1 basis point at 2.289%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

0637 GMT - The Reserve Bank of India is likely to cut rates by another 75bps during this cycle, following its 25bps rate reduction earlier today, Capital Economics' Shilan Shah says in a commentary. India's economy will probably stay in a soft patch for a few more quarters, the deputy chief emerging markets economist says. Today's rate cut by the RBI confirms that its priorities have shifted to offering more support for the economy from containing inflation, the economist says. The Indian central bank's new governor also sounded more bearish on the economic growth outlook than his predecessor, the economist adds. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

0635 GMT - The Reserve Bank of India's decision to cut the benchmark interest rate aims to stimulate economic growth but could have some negative effects, says Umeshkumar Mehta, CIO at Samco Mutual Fund. The move aligns the RBI with global central banks, which have been easing rates since last year to counter economic slowdowns. However, it is also expected to widen the gap between U.S. and Indian bond yields, Mehta says in a note. This could accelerate capital outflows from India, he adds. With U.S. bond yields on an upward trend, the rupee is facing added depreciation pressure, exacerbating currency risks, the CIO says. The rate cut could prove to be a balancing act between currency stability and stimulating consumption, he says. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)

0625 GMT - India's central bank has limited scope for rate cuts going forward, Apurva Sheth of SAMCO Securities says in commentary. The Reserve Bank of India delivered its first rate cut of 25 bps on Friday after keeping rates on hold for almost two years, which is likely a "welcomed step in the right direction" for markets, Sheth says. However, the depth of the easing cycle and the timing of further rate cuts will depend on the Fed's next moves, as the central bank remains cautious about the potential inflationary impact of President Trump's economic policies, Sheth adds. The Indian rupee is also a concern, as it has depreciated to an all-time low, Sheth notes. (kimberley.kao@wsj.com)

\*\* Shares in Finnish construction firm YIT slump 13% on disappointing quarterly operating profit and 2025 earnings outlook

\*\* Q4 adj. EBIT of EUR 13 million ($13.5 million) was clearly below what was expected by analysts polled by Vara

\*\* "Consensus expected an adjusted operating profit of EUR 22 million and a margin of 4%, against which the result was clearly disappointing," Inderes analyst Olli Koponen says

\*\* YIT sees 2025 adj. EBIT of EUR 20-60 million, while Inderes' estimate stood at the upper end of that range at EUR 56 million

\*\* "Consensus expected an adjusted operating profit of EUR 62 million in 2025," Koponen adds

\*\* If the losses hold, YIT shares will see their worst day since July 2008

($1 = 0.9623 euros)

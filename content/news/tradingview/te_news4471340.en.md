The Sensex failed to hold onto early gains to close slightly about 0.3% down at 77,860 on Friday, marking the third straight session of decreases, as investors engaged in profit-taking amid and anticipated RBI's rate cut and foreign fund outflows.

The Reserve Bank of India lowered the repo rate by 25bps to 6.25% to spur growth but some investors had expected the central bank to cut banks' cash reserve ratio (CRR) to further boost liquidity.

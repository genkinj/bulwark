Sitoy Group expects a loss attributable to the owners between HK$60 million and HK$75 million for the six months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, against an attributable profit of HK$53.5 million logged for the same period in the preceding year, a Friday bourse filing said.

The luggage and leather goods stores company attributed the expected swing to geopolitical tensions, global inflationary pressures, and a one-off loss from the termination of its Cole Haan Business.

\*\* Poultry seller Venky's India down 6.49% at 1,786.45 rupees after Q3 results

\*\* Stock set for sharpest one-day fall since Q2 print on November 7

\*\* Co reports 7.5% decline in Q3 revenue from operations due to stress in oilseeds business

\*\* VENK getting lower prices for edible oil and de-oiled cake

\*\* Oilseed revenue, which makes up nearly 36% of total, falls to 3.25 bln rupees from 4.61 bln rupees a year ago

\*\* However, better poultry revenue and lower input costs help co return to profit vs year ago loss

\*\* With session's decline, VENK shares down ~10% in last 12 months

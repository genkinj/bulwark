AltaGas and Keyera announced Friday long-term commercial agreements that use their infrastructure to provide value-added services to customers and strengthen the companies' long-term growth outlook.

Keyera entered a 15-year tolling contract at AltaGas' Ridley Island Energy Export Facility for 12,500 barrels per day (bbls/d) of liquified petroleum gases (LPG) export capacity.

The new agreement will provide Keyera the ability to offer its customers more diversified market access for LPGs, including Asian markets, while providing AltaGas with long-term ratable export volumes and cash flows.

AltaGas entered an 18-year agreement for 8,000 bbls/d of fractionation capacity at Keyera Fort Saskatchewan, which includes the natural gas liquids that will be produced from AltaGas' Pipestone II plant currently under construction.

These volume commitments will provide AltaGas long-term fractionation capacity for its Alberta Montney production, the companies said.

"We are pleased to partner with Keyera and execute long-term agreements that will improve the value of both companies' infrastructure and ensure we're collectively delivering the best outcomes for the Canadian energy industry" said Vern Yu, president and CEO of AltaGas.

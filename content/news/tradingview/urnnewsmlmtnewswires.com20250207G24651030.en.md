Danske Bank's stock jumped nearly 6% on late Friday morning as it delivered a record-breaking net profit for full-year 2024, paving the way for significant returns to its shareholders.

Denmark's largest bank booked a net profit of 23.63 billion kroner for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2024, from the year-ago 21.26 billion kroner, improving its return on equity after tax to 13.4% from 12.7%. The increase in net profit was bolstered by solid customer activity and net loan impairment reversals of 543 million kroner, against a year-ago net charge of 262 million kroner, according to a Friday release.

Total income also grew over the period to 56.41 billion kroner from 52.42 billion kroner, on the back of higher net interest income and net fee income. Operating expenses edged up 1% to 25.74 billion kroner, mainly due to higher investments in the lender's technology transformation under its new strategy and staff costs that were impacted by wage inflation.

"The first year of execution of our Forward '28 strategy, 2024 was an important year for Danske Bank's financial performance: With income growth driven by our growing core income as well as our continued efforts to support customers and drive the commercial momentum, net profit represents a record-high result," said Chief Financial Officer Stephan Engels.

Meanwhile, the board proposed a dividend of 9.35 kroner per share for the second half of 2024, along with an extraordinary dividend of 5.35 kroner per share and a special dividend of 6.50 kroner per share linked to the transfer of its personal customer business in Norway. This brings the total full-year dividend to 28.70 kroner per share, up from the year-ago 14.50 kroner per share.

Danske Bank also unveiled a new share buyback program of up to 5 billion kroner, which is set to commence on Feb. 10, 2025, and conclude by Jan. 30, 2026.

"Given our strong balance sheet, and as planned in the Forward '28 strategy, the financial year 2024 yields a significant payout to our shareholders," the banking group noted.

Looking ahead, Danske Bank anticipates total income for 2025 to be "slightly lower" than in 2024 amid expected lower market rates, with net profit projected to be between 21 billion kroner and 23 billion kroner.

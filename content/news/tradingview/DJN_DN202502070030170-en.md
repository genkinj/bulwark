Nordic markets are seen opening slightly lower, with IG calling the OMXS30 down 0.1% at around 2663. The S&P500 and Nasdaq ended higher yesterday after mixed earnings reports that also saw Amazon shares drop after lower-than-expected results, SEB analysts say in a note. January's U.S. jobs data are in focus Friday. SEB expects employment growth to stabilize somewhat below pre-pandemic rates with the unemployment rate remaining low. Also due are the U.S. confidence indicator from the University of Michigan while the European Central Bank will announce new estimates for the neutral interest rate. OMXS30 closed at 2665.74, OMXN40 at 2626.04 and OBX at 1413.97. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

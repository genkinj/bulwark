Despite regulatory hurdles, the outlook for a Solana-based exchange traded fund (ETF) has also brightened considerably.

On Jan. 29, Cboe BZX Exchange reignited the race for Solana-based ETFs by refiling a new batch of applications on behalf of four major investment firms. The exchange fresh 19b-4 filings for the Canary Solana Trust, Bitwise Solana ETF, 21Shares Core Solana ETF, and VanEck Solana Trust.

These filings have prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to restart its review process for spot Solana investment products, following the withdrawal of previous applications at the SEC’s request last year.

If approved, these Solana ETFs would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Solana without directly holding the cryptocurrency, potentially broadening access to the digital asset market and attracting significant institutional capital.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries' profit attributable to owners of the parent rebounded to 44.2 billion yen in the fiscal nine months ended Dec. 31, 2024, compared with a 13.5 billion yen loss a year ago.

The heavy equipment and engines manufacturer said earnings per share turned positive, reaching 263.64 yen, from a loss of 80.48 yen a year ago, according to a filing.

Sales revenue rose 15% to 1.407 trillion yen from 1.229 trillion yen a year earlier.

It forecasted attributable profit to rise significantly to 78 billion yen, and net sales to increase to 2.160 trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31.

It did not declare or make any dividend forecast for the current year.

In a separate filing, Kawasaki reported a foreign exchange gain of 13.6 billion yen in the third quarter, due to exchange rate fluctuations.

However, this gain was offset by the foreign exchange loss of 15.8 billion yen in the first six months, translating into a total foreign exchange loss of 2.11 billion yen for the nine months ending Dec 31, 2024.

The S&P 500 gained 0.2% and the Nasdaq rose 0.3% while the Dow Jones swung around the flatline on Friday, as traders digested the latest jobs report and corporate results.

Payroll growth came in well below expectations at 143K but the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4%, and wage growth accelerated to 0.5%.

The data reinforced the Fedâ€™s stance on keeping interest rates steady for now, prompting traders to scale back expectations for rate cuts.

Meanwhile, shares of Amazon lost more than 2% after the company projected first-quarter revenue growth of 5% to 9%, which would mark its slowest growth rate on record.

Consumer discretionary and materials were the worst performing sectors while the tech sector outperformed.

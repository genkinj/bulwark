U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday after data showed that employers added fewer jobs than expected in January, while wage inflation beat economists' expectations.

Employers added 143,000 jobs last month, below economists' expectations for 170,000 job gains. Average hourly earnings rose by 4.1% on an annual basis, above expectations for a 3.8% increase.

The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes was last up 3.4 basis points on the day at 4.473%. The 2-year note (US2YT=RR) yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose 3.3 basis points to 4.241%.

The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes (US2US10=TWEB) steepened by around a basis point to 23.3 basis points.

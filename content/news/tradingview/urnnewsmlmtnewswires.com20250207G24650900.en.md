MicroSalt agreed to raise an extra 100,100 pounds sterling from an investor after an administrative oversight prevented the processing of its legitimate order in a fundraising unveiled on Feb. 3.

The British natural salt producer therefore issued 143,000 new ordinary shares at 0.70 pound each and granted two warrants per share to the investor, with the same terms of the fundraising, according to a Friday release. The additional shares are expected to start trading on Feb. 13.

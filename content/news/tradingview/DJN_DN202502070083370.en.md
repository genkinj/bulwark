Live cattle futures on the CME are up 0.1%, inching higher after falling 2.2% yesterday. "Fund liquidation resumed on Thursday," says AgResource in a note, adding that boxed beef prices were mixed yesterday, which also put some pressure on cattle futures. Trading is tentative as managed money traders hold a large net long position in cattle - which traders fear makes the contract susceptible to a large downturn if negative news hits the market, says AgResource. The CFTC will release updated Commitment of Traders data this afternoon. Lean hogs are also a nudge higher, with the most-active contract up 0.2%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)

ZAGREB (Croatia), February 7 (SeeNews) - Croatian electrical equipment manufacturer Koncar Elektroindustrija [ZSE:KOEI] said it has become direct owner of a majority stake in power transmission equipment manufacturer Dalekovod [ZSE:DLKV], following the completion of a merger with Koncar’s fully-owned investment arm Napredna Energetska Rjesenja.

On February 4, a settlement of securities was carried out, by which Koncar acquired 31,000,000 shares of Dalekovod, representing a stake of 75.16%, in accordance with the merger agreement between Koncar and Napredna Energetska Rjesenja, Koncar said in a filing to the Zagreb bourse on Thursday.

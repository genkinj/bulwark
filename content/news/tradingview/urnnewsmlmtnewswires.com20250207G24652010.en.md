Lloyds Banking Group will open 1,200 new positions as part of plans to expand its in-house technology and engineering capabilities, according to an e-mailed statement sent to MT Newswires on Friday.

The British lender said the new positions will be spread across its software and platform engineering, technical platform specialists, technology, architecture, and data engineering teams. It noted, however, that some employees may not secure a role under the changes due to the reduced future demand for certain positions.

City AM reported earlier that Lloyds placed up to 6,000 technology and engineering staff under review amid its business restructure. The evaluation period is expected to last four weeks, with the concerned employees either transitioned to new roles or laid off, it added.

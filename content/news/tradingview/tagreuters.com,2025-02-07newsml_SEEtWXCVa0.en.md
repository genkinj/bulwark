TIRANA (Albania), February 7 (SeeNews) - The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to extend again the temporary foreign collateralised agreement (repo) line with the central bank of Albania by two more years, until January 31, 2027, the Albanian central bank said on Friday.

The agreement was extended without changing the conditions, allowing the Bank of Albania to access the liquidity line with a maximum borrowable amount of 400 million euro ($415 million), the central bank said in a statement.

Under a repo line, a national central bank can borrow euro up to a specified limit in exchange for euro-denominated collateral.

"Although this liquidity line has not been used so far, the Bank of Albania considers that this back-up instrument remains supportive to the monetary and financial stability of Albania, in view of heightened uncertainties stemming from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, tensions in Middle East, and their potential risks for the global economy and financial markets," the central bank said.

The repo line was first established in 2020 as part of a larger initiative to support institutions in non-euro area central banks, in view of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the ECB has said.

In 2022, the Albanian repo line was extended until January 2024, and in January 2024, it was extended until January 2025.

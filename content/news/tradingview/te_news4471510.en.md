The British pound steadied at $1.243 after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 4.5% and slashed its growth forecast for the year to 0.75%, half its previous estimate.

Governor Andrew Bailey urged investors not to overanalyze policymakers’ shift toward deeper cuts, but markets remained uncertain.

The BoE also raised its inflation forecast to 3.7%—well above its prior 2.8% estimate—highlighting the challenge of balancing rate cuts with persistent price pressures.

With three cuts since August, traders still expect around 60 basis points of further easing this year.

Meanwhile, in the US, markets largely shrugged off the latest jobs report, reinforcing the Fed’s view of a solid labor market with no immediate need to adjust rate expectations.

Although Ashmore Group's 1H outflows continued, there has been a persistent improvement as 2Q net outflows were just $400 million, Peel Hunt analysts Stuart Duncan and Robert Sage say. This in turn saw total assets under management falling just 1% to close at $48.8 billion, and Ebitda above consensus expectations at 34 million pounds, the analysts say in a note. Net management fees fell 17% to 68 million pounds, a reflection of lower AuMs and revenue margins moderating above expectations, which were offset by well-controlled costs, the analysts say. "Having faced significant challenges for some time, there remains a more positive tone to the outlook," the analysts say. Shares are down 0.5% at 170.70 pence and up 6.75% in the year-to-date.

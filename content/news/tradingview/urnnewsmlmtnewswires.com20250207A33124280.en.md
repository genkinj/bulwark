Silver Storm Mining said overnight Thursday that it closed the final tranche of its non-brokered private placement offering to raise a total of $3.9 million.

Under the final tranche of the offering, the company issued 5,043,335 units priced at $0.09 apiece for $453,900.18 in proceeds.

Each unit consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant. Each warrant is exercisable for $0.16 per share for 36 months.

The company plans to use the proceeds to complete a NI 43-101 mineral resource statement for the La Parrilla project in Mexico, as well as for general corporate and working capital purposes.

Silver Storm's share price rose 3.7% on Thursday to $0.14 on the TSXV.

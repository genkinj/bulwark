Gränges has successfully issued a five-year senior unsecured green bond of SEK 600 million under the company’s Medium-Term Note (MTN) program. The green bond is due in 2030 and carries a coupon rate of three-month Stibor plus 1.30 percent. The issuance attracted strong interest from investors, with an order book exceeding SEK 2.2 billion.

The proceeds from this green bond will be allocated to eligible green projects in line with Gränges’ Green Finance framework.

"This successful inaugural green bond issuance underscores our commitment to sustainability and highlights the confidence investors have in Gränges’ strategic direction", said Gränges’ CFO, Oskar Hellström.

Danske Bank and Handelsbanken acted as Joint Lead Managers on the transaction and Structuring Advisors on the Finance Frameworks.

Gränges published an updated Green Finance Framework on October 31, 2024. More information about the framework is available on Gränges’ website: https://www.granges.com/investors/credit-market/

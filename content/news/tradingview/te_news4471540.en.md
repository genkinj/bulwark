The euro slipped below $1.04 as investors anticipated a growing interest rate gap between the US and Europe.

US jobs data reinforced the Federal Reserve’s stance that no immediate rate adjustments were needed, strengthening the dollar.

In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) recently cut rates and signaled potential further easing in March.

Concerns over US tariffs possibly triggering deflationary pressures have fueled expectations of deeper ECB cuts, with markets now forecasting the deposit rate to drop to 1.87% by December.

Additionally, fears surrounding President Trump’s trade policies, including potential new tariffs on the EU, are dampening sentiment.

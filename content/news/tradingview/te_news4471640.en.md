Silver rose to the $32.5 per ounce on Friday, the highest in three months, supported by the outlook of looser financial conditions, stronger demand manufacturing inputs, and supply deficits.

Traders remained positioned for multiple rate cuts by the Fed this year, as signaled by the FOMC in its latest projections, despite the batch of strong labor figures from January.

Looser policy was also penned by the ECB, BoE, RBI, and BoC. In the meantime, the unexpected rebound for the US manufacturing sector, according to the ISM PMI, improved the outlook for silver as a key material for electrification technologies.

On the supply side, the Silver Institute recently forecast a fifth consecutive year of significant market deficits in 2025, driven by strong industrial demand and robust retail investment.

These factors are expected to offset weaker consumption in jewelry and silverware.

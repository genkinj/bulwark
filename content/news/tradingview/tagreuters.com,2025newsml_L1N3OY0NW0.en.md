Germany's Deutsche Energy Terminal said on Friday it has successfully sold all liquefied natural gas regasification slots offered at the liquefied gas terminals of Brunsbuettel and Wilhelmshaven for this year.

The strong demand for the slots shows how countries affected by the ending of pipeline gas supply from Russia to Central Europe in January are looking for more LNG deliveries and alternative supply routes.

"Slots were marketed both with and without obligation to deliver for the traders. All 50 slots offered were sold," DET said in a statement.

The bookings show growing interest by traders in using German LNG terminals, with Germany becoming a transit hub for onward supplies to Eastern Europe after scrapping of a fee for transporting gas across borders.

The average price achieved in the December auction was 0.11 euros per million British thermal units (mmBtu), while the February auction average price was 0.30 euros per mmBtu.

"We are looking ahead as the currently declining storage levels must be replenished in good time during the year," Peter Roettgen, DET managing director, said in a statement.

DET is a state-owned German company responsible for operating terminals where LNG is imported via ship.

Wilhelmshaven on Germany's north coast and Brunsbuettel on the Elbe River in northern Germany are floating storage and regasification units that were installed to counter the loss of Russian pipeline supply to Germany in 2022.

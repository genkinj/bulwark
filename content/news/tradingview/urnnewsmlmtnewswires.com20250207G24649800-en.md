Henkel agreed to sell its Retailer Brands business in North America as the conclusion of its portfolio optimization drive for its consumer brands business.

The German consumer goods and chemicals company said Friday the Retailer Brands business, including detergents, fabric finishers, and dishwashing products, will be sold to an affiliate of US-based First Quality Enterprises.

The companies agreed not to disclose the financial details of the deal, which is subject to regulatory and other approvals.

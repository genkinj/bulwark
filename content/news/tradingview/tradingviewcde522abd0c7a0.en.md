PhenixFIN Corp, a company specializing in generating current income and capital appreciation through loans, private equity, and other investments in privately-held companies, has released its Form 10-Q report for the fourth quarter of 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial and operational performance, reflecting its strategic initiatives and market conditions.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Investment Income**: $6.2 million, reflecting an increase from the previous year's $5.7 million, driven by higher portfolio interest and dividend income.

**Net Investment Income/(Loss)**: $1.6 million, a slight decrease from $1.7 million in the prior year, impacted by increased interest and financing expenses.

**Net Realized Gains (Losses) on Investments**: $1.2 million, primarily due to gains on PHH Mortgage Corp. and Chimera Investment Corp.

**Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments**: $(0.3) million, resulting from depreciation on Black Angus Steakhouses and reversal of gains on PHH Mortgage Corp., partially offset by appreciation on JFL-NGS-WGS Partners, LLC.

**Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations**: $2.5 million, compared to $4.5 million in the previous year, reflecting changes in realized and unrealized gains and losses.

**Net Income Per Share**: $1.22, down from $2.19 in the prior year, due to the decrease in net assets resulting from operations.

**Business Highlights**

**Portfolio and Investment Activity**: As of December 31, 2024, the company's portfolio had a fair market value of approximately $300.1 million, showing an increase from $227.9 million as of September 30, 2024. This growth was driven by new investments totaling $100.9 million during the quarter, offset by proceeds from sales and settlements of $30.0 million.

**Investment Strategy**: The company focuses on generating current income and capital appreciation through loans, private equity, and other investments in privately-held companies, with a portfolio primarily consisting of senior secured first lien term loans, senior secured second lien term loans, senior secured bonds, preferred equity, and common equity.

**Risk Profile and Credit Ratings**: The company rates its investments on a scale from 1 to 5, with 90.6% of investments rated as performing within expectations (rating 2) as of December 31, 2024. This indicates a stable risk profile for the majority of the portfolio.

**Interest Rate Environment Impact**: The company is exposed to rising interest rates, which could increase borrowing costs and affect net investment income. The current interest rate environment has led to increased interest expenses due to higher borrowings.

**Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan**: The company has implemented a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan to reward key employees based on performance goals related to net asset value and NAV per share. This plan aims to align employee incentives with company performance.

**Future Outlook**: The company anticipates continued market volatility due to global events, which could impact the valuation of portfolio investments. Management remains focused on navigating these challenges while seeking suitable investment opportunities.

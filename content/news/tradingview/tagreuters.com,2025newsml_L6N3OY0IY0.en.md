Congressional Republicans’ tax and spending package will be announced this weekend, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Friday.

“Probably not today,” Johnson said of an announcement. “We got a few more things to work on today and tomorrow, but we're planning for a mark up on probably Tuesday.”

Johnson and other Republicans met with President Donald Trump for five hours on Thursday, but did not emerge with an agreement on how to extend his sweeping tax cuts.

"BALANCED BUDGET!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. That would require lawmakers to close a deficit that hit $1.9 trillion in the most recent fiscal year, equal to 6.6% of GDP.

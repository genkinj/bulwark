\*\* Credit ratings firm Equifax reported worse-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday, on a weaker hiring market and slower-than-expected mortgage growth

\*\* Shares fell over 8.4% on Thursday

\*\* At least six brokerages cut PT on stock after results

MACRO STRUGGLES CONTINUE

\*\* J.P. Morgan ("overweight", cuts PT to $277 from $283) says they are reducing 2026 estimates on uncertainty around the timing of a recovery in both the mortgage market as well as gross hiring activity

\*\* "A range of macro factors including interest rates or economic hiccups could impact consumer spending trends and lead to reduced demand for Equifax's credit data," brokerage says

\*\* Oppenheimer ("outperform", cuts PT to $279 from $286) says regulatory changes by the Federal Housing Finance Agency could hold adverse implications for EFX and reduce demand for its services

\*\* Stifel ("buy", cuts PT to $281 from $284) says the current environment could result in lower high-margin revenue

\*\* Needham ("buy", cuts PT to $300 from $325) says co's challenges are consistent with the macro data as mortgage rates remain well above historical levels and white-collar hiring activity continues to be sluggish

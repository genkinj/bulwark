\*\* Yum Brands beat estimates for Q4 comparable sales and profit on Thursday, on value offerings driving demand at Taco Bell

\*\* At least four brokerages raised PT on stock, with median PT of 23 brokerages at $90 - data compiled by LSEG

CHALLENGES REMAIN DESPITE TACO BELL BOOST

\*\* TD Cowen ("hold", PT raised by $11 to $151) sees further potential for Taco Bell outperformance and China stimulus tailwind, but says these are not sufficient to overpower development weakness and "opacity" in emerging markets view

\*\* Jefferies ("hold", PT raised by $5 to $138) says visibility still clouded given international franchise issues, tepid China and tough U.S. fast-food environment, but sees Taco Bell to continue outperforming

\*\* BofA ("neutral", PT raised by $10 to $153) is "cautiously optimistic" on account of Pizza Hut headwinds, challenged international unit development; sees 2025 to be another year of below-algorithm unit growth

\*\* BTIG ("neutral") believes past year's results have been impressive against broader industry challenges, but has stronger conviction in other names amongst their coverage, including McDonald's

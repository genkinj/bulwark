\*\* Eli Lilly on Thursday suggested that demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound, its popular diabetes and weight-loss treatments, was not a concern, easing investor agitation about signs of weakness in sales of the drugs

\*\* Stock up 0.4% at $873.51 in premarket trading

\*\* Average rating of 28 analysts on Lilly is the equivalent of "buy" and their median PT is $988.50, LSEG data shows

A HEALTHY BOTTOM LINE

\*\* J.P.Morgan ("overweight," PT: $1,100) expects Mounjaro sales to surge ~240% to $64 bln from 2025-2030 and Zepbound sales to rocket ~430% to $64 bln in the same period, driven by greater access/penetration

\*\* Morningstar (fair value: $620) thinks the GLP-1 market could exceed $75 billion in 2025 and expects LLY's sales to increase by $13 bln, outpacing Novo's $9 bln growth

\*\* Truist Securities ("buy," PT: $1,038) sees growth in oncology, immunology and neuroscience, boosting revenue and margins driven by recent approvals of Omvoh (Crohn's disease), Ebglyss (Eczema), Kisunla (Alzheimer's), Zepbound (sleep apnea)

\*\* Jefferies ("buy," PT: $1,020) sees orforglipron (orfo), an oral drug for diabetes and obesity, showing Wegovy-like safety and efficacy heading into late-stage tests

By Steve Goldstein

Bond yields held to a tight range on Friday ahead of the key U.S. jobs report.

What's happening

* The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was 4.24%, up 1.5 basis points. Yields move in the opposite direction to prices.
* The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was 4.44%, down 0.8 basis point.
* The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y was 4.64%, or unchanged on the basis-points metric.

What's driving markets

The 10-year yield on Thursday finished at its second-lowest level of the year, according to Dow Jones Market data.

Expectations are for the U.S. Labor Department to report that 169,000 new jobs were created in January and for the jobless rate to stay at 4.1%.

Analysts at UBS said the bulk of the yield decline this week came from the reaction to the services-sector survey released Wednesday. They added that the consensus expectation for jobs growth is "solid" and that the U.S. economy remains resilient.

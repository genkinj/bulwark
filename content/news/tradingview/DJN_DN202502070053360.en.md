Gold futures rise, sitting just below its all-time record. Futures are up 0.55% at $2,892.50 a troy ounce, just shy of the all-time high of $2,906, set on Wednesday. Rather than the usual price drivers--the strength of the U.S. dollar and interest rate expectations--it is safe-haven demand in politically turbulent times that drives the rally, Commerzbank analysts say. This particularly reflects uncertainties surrounding the policies of President Trump, they say in a note. A sharp rise in lease rates also indicates tension in the physical market. That said, there are already signs of an exaggeration, and a price correction in the coming weeks is likely, Commerzbank writes. Spot gold prices should trade at $2,700 an ounce by the middle of the year and $2,650 an ounce by the end of 2025, Commerzbank adds.(joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

Danske Bank said Friday its net profit and total income for full-year 2024 increased year over year.

Net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31,Â 2024, was 23.63 billion Danish kroner, compared with 21.26 billion kroner earlier. EPS moved to 27.8 kroner from 24.7 kroner.

The Danish lender's total income was 56.41 billion kroner, compared with 52.42 billion kroner a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting 55.51 billion kroner in sales, 22.75 billion kroner in net income, and 26.80 kroner in EPS.

Meanwhile, the board proposed a dividend of 9.35 kroner per share, an extraordinary dividend of 5.35 kroner per share and a special dividend of 6.50 kroner per share for the second half. It paid 7.50 kroner per share a year ago. This takes the full-year dividend to 28.70 kroner per share, up from 14.50 kroner per share in the previous year.

Looking ahead, the bank expects total income for 2025 to be "slightly lower" than 2024, with net profit between 21 billion kroner and 23 billion kroner.

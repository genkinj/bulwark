Green Plains Inc., a leading biorefining company, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company, which focuses on the development and utilization of fermentation, agricultural, and biological technologies, reported significant changes in its financial performance compared to the previous year.

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Green Plains reported a net loss attributable to the company of $54.9 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share, compared to a net income of $7.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $584.0 million, down from $712.4 million in the prior year. The company's EBITDA was $(18.9) million for the quarter, a significant decrease from $44.7 million in the same period in 2023.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Green Plains' ethanol production segment sold 209.5 million gallons of ethanol during the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to 215.7 million gallons in the same period in 2023. The consolidated ethanol crush margin was $(15.5) million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $53.0 million for the same period in 2023. The company also reported a decrease in revenues within its ethanol production segment due to lower weighted average selling prices and volumes of ethanol, distillers grains, and renewable corn oil.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Green Plains has launched a corporate reorganization and cost reduction initiative aimed at significantly reducing ongoing expenses, with an anticipated annualized benefit of up to $50 million. The company has already implemented $30 million in improvements. Additionally, Green Plains has idled its Fairmont, Minnesota facility due to sustained localized margin pressure from flooding in the region.

The company achieved key milestones for its 'Advantage Nebraska' carbon strategy, including the receipt of six Class VI Carbon Capture and Sequestration well permits in Wyoming and the commencement of construction to connect Nebraska plants to the Trailblazer mainline.

**Management's Perspective**

Todd Becker, President and CEO of Green Plains, commented on the results, stating, "As we embark on 2025, we have launched a corporate reorganization and cost reduction initiative which will significantly reduce expenses on an ongoing basis. Over the last several years, we have strategically allocated capital in sales, marketing, and innovation to develop and validate our ingredients and get them to market. We are moving from that phase to the commercialization phase of our strategy, which includes the rationalization of expenses."

Becker also highlighted the progress of the 'Advantage Nebraska' strategy and the company's clean sugar facility, which has begun producing on-spec product and sending samples to customers for validation.

**Future Outlook**

Green Plains' 'Advantage Nebraska' strategy remains on track, with the company expecting to benefit from the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. The company's carbon capture operations in Nebraska are on pace to begin sequestering biogenic carbon dioxide in the second half of 2025. Additionally, the company expects its cost reduction initiatives and carbon earnings from Nebraska to achieve a combined $180 million annualized contribution to future earnings.

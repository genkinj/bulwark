Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler on Friday said that with inflation going sideways and even firming somewhat, and given the healthy labor market and uncertainties over the impact of the new administration's policies on the economy, it is "prudent" to hold the policy rate steady for some time to see how it all plays out.

Kugler said she would need to see more slowing in inflation to feel comfortable cutting rates, and the solid economy and strength of the labor market "gives us a little bit of time" to wait for that.

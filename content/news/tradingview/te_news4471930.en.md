The yield on Brazil’s 10-year government bond hovered above 14.7%, approaching the March 2016 high of 15.3%, amid persistent concerns over fiscal discipline and the economic impact of the central bank’s aggressive rate hikes.

The Selic rate was raised to 13.25%, with a further 100bps hike committed for March, signaling a firm stance on inflation control but also amplifying worries about the economic toll of prolonged tightening.

Inflation expectations for 2025 and 2026 increased to 5.5% and 4.2%, respectively, raising concerns over unanchored inflation and a weakening real.

Ongoing trade tariff uncertainty and inflationary pressures, particularly in the service sector, further contributed to market unease, as the central bank acknowledged downside risks from a potential domestic slowdown.

These factors combined to increase risk premiums, adding to the broader concerns about Brazil’s economic stability.

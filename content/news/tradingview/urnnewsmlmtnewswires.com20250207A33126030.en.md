Sportradar Group and Major League Baseball said Friday they have extended and expanded their decade-long partnership for the 2025 to 2032 seasons.

Sportradar will be the exclusive worldwide distributor of MLB's ultra-low latency official data, media content, and AV content, including MLB Statcast Data, to its network of 800 sportsbook clients and 900 media companies, the companies said.

Sportradar will continue providing integrity services, including its Universal Fraud Detection System, and support MLB's investigative and educational efforts to safeguard the sport, they added.

Both organizations will also work together to develop AI-driven products based on player tracking data to enhance fan experiences, according to the companies.

Under the agreement, MLB has purchased equity stake in Sportradar, which will also pay annual license fees for the rights, along with up to 1.9 million Class A common shares over the term, the companies added.

Shares of the company were up about 3% in recent pre-market activity.

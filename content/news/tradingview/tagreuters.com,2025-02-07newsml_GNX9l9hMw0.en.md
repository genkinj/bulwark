January same-store sales increased 4.7% year-over-year

NEWARK, N.J., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — NRSInsights, a provider of sales data and analytics drawn from retail transactions processed through the National Retail Solutions (NRS) point-of-sale (POS) platform, today announced comparative retail same-store sales results for January 2025.

**Retail Trade Comparative Data**

The table below provides historical comparative data with the U.S. Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade same-store sales data excluding food service:

Over the past twelve months, the NRS network’s three-month moving average same-store sales have outpaced the US Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade data, excluding food services, by 1.1% percentage points, on average. However, in December, the Department’s three month rolling average increase exceeded the NRS network’s by 0.5%.

The NRSInsights data in the chart above have not been adjusted to reflect inflation, demographic distributions, seasonal buying patterns, item substitution, days per month, or other factors that may facilitate comparisons to other periods, to other same-store retail sales data, or to the U.S. Commerce Department’s retail data.

**Commentary from Suzy Silliman** *(SVP, Data Strategy and Sales at NRS)*

“Despite record-breaking cold temperatures and historic snowfalls in mid-January across much of the U.S., January 2025 saw robust dollar, unit and transaction same-store sales growth versus the year ago while decreasing sequentially, as expected, following the holiday season.

“Our analysis of January’s data revealed several unexpected developments across the NRS network, while other categories continued trends that carried over from 2024.

“January sales typically follow well-established patterns related to New Year's resolutions, wellness goals, and ‘dry January.’ So this January’s dollar sales growth in Tobacco Products & Accessories (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, lighters and rolling papers), Alcohol (beer, FMB/cider/seltzer, vodka, still wine, tequila, prepared cocktails, wine-based cocktails, and cordials), and even Chocolate and Cookies was unusual.

“On the other hand, the Diet & Nutrition category outperformed, driven by growth in health/nutrition and meal replacement shakes, health/nutrition and meal replacement bars, protein salty snacks, and health/nutrition powder. While Diet & Nutrition sales had been trending up with the increased popularity of GLP-1 agonists for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, January’s year-over-year growth exceeded the prior months’ trendline.

“And finally, sales of Cold/Flu OTC products and GI Care surged year-over-year as flu, RSV, norovirus and other contagions surged nationwide, arriving a little later in the season than usual but not unexpectedly.”

Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and French billionaire Xavier Niel are said to be looking at separate deals for Telecom Italia (TIT.MI), Bloomberg News reported Friday.

CVC is in talks to acquire Vivendi's 24% stake in Telecom Italia, a move that could eventually lead to the private equity firm taking control of the Italian telecoms giant, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, Iliad, which is owned by Niel, is reportedly working on a plan to acquire 35% of Telecom Italia by merging its Italian unit with the telco. Iliad is also looking to secure a whitewash waiver to prevent triggering a full takeover bid.

CVC, Telecom Italia and Iliad did not immediately respond to MT Newswires' requests for comment.

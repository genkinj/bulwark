Avon Freight Group selects INBS’ fingerprint drug testing for three UK sites, reinforcing workplace safety and efficiency

INBS surpasses 400+ accounts in 19 countries, targeting aggressive U.S. expansion in 2025 following FDA 510(k) submission

UK drug testing market projected to hit $453M by 2030, positioning INBS as a scalable, cost-effective industry leader

NEW YORK, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Intelligent Bio Solutions Inc. ("INBS" or the "Company"), a medical technology company delivering intelligent, rapid, non-invasive testing solutions, today announced that Avon Freight Group ("Avon") has selected its non-invasive Intelligent Fingerprinting Drug Testing Solution for random drug testing across its three UK sites, supporting proactive risk management and employee well-being. The addition of Avon further expands INBS’ client network of over 400 accounts in 19 countries.

Avon is implementing in-house drug testing for the first time, seeking a more respectful and practical alternative to the costly and intrusive random oral swab testing previously carried out by external providers. Avon's adoption of INBS' less invasive, rapid, and hygienic fingerprint sweat-based drug testing supports its efforts to improve workplace safety while maintaining a positive work culture.

Martin Bullimore, Commercial & Procurement Contracts Manager at Avon Freight Group, commented, "We've never had an in-house testing solution before, and moving to fingerprint drug testing is a big step forward for us. We recognized the need for a more proactive approach to workplace testing and appreciated the non-invasive nature of this solution. The system allows us to conduct random testing without disrupting operations or imposing on our employees' personal lives and reinforces our commitment to a safe, effective, and respectful workplace. The feedback has been extremely positive overall, with many stakeholders realizing its value.”

As more businesses in the logistics and transport sector recognize the limitations of traditional drug screening methods, solutions such as INBS' Drug Screening System are increasingly becoming the preferred choice. Market research estimates the UK Drug of Abuse Testing Services Market to be the fastest-growing regional market in Europe1, projected to reach $453 million by 20302. INBS is well-established and positioned to satisfy this growing demand with its scalable and cost-effective solution.

The Company expects further growth this year, following its U.S. FDA 510(k) submission in December 2024. Expansion into the U.S. presents significant opportunities for INBS and its innovative drug testing technology. The Company's unique, non-invasive solution addresses the challenges faced by safety-sensitive industries, streamlines drug testing processes, and provides an alternative that supports employee well-being and compliance. By leveraging its expertise and proven success in the UK, INBS aims to establish a strong foothold in the U.S. market.

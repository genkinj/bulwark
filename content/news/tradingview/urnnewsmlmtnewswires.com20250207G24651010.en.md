The UK Panel on Takeover and Mergers approved the extension of the deadline for Kondor AI (KNDR.AQ) to announce its firm intention to buy Ora Technology (ORA.AQ) to March 7 from Friday.

The artificial intelligence products developer and the software company said in separate Friday filings that discussions remain at an advanced stage, while noting that there is no certainty of a deal being closed.

Kondor offered 0.9988 of its shares in exchange for each Ora share in August 2024. The companies agreed on a revised ratio of 0.9848 Kondor shares for each share in Ora after the latter issued new ordinary shares in December 2024.

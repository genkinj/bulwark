The dollar trades steady in early European trade but could fall slightly if U.S. January nonfarm payrolls data at 1330 GMT are weaker, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. The data could show growth in jobs and wages slowed while the unemployment rate held steady, she says. Annual revisions could also be adjusted downwards. In that case, "the week will end with the narrative that the U.S. jobs market is healthily slowing." That would allow the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates slowly. Any dollar depreciation will remain limited against European currencies due to expectations for more rate cuts compared with the U.S. and safe-haven demand. The DXY dollar index is steady at 107.728.

German medical packaging maker Gerresheimer is exploring a potential sale amid interest from private equity funds, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Its shares jumped as much as 15% after the news.

The firm is working with advisers to gauge interest from possible buyers, the report said, adding that Warburg Pincus, EQT AB and KKR are among suitors that have been studying the business.

Activist investor Ricky Chad Sandler had bought a 5.43% stake in the German medical packaging maker in October 2024.

Gerresheimer did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

US consumer sentiment reached its lowest level since last July, while year-ahead inflation expectations hit the highest since November 2023, preliminary results from the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers showed Friday.

The main sentiment gauge dropped to 67.8 this month from 71.1 in January. The consensus was for a 71.8 print in a survey compiled by Bloomberg. On an annual basis, the measure is down nearly 12%, the survey showed.

"The decrease was pervasive, with Republicans, independents, and Democrats all posting sentiment declines from January, along with consumers across age and wealth groups," Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said. "Many consumers appear worried that high inflation will return within the next year."

The year-ahead inflation outlook surged to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking only the fifth time in 14 years there has been such a large one-month rise in the measure, according to Hsu. Consumers' five-year price growth projection rose to 3.3% from 3.2%, the survey showed.

Late last month, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged following three consecutive cuts and said inflation remained "somewhat elevated."

The survey pointed to deterioration in all five index components in February, led by a 12% drop in buying conditions for durables. Hsu said this was partly driven by a perception that "it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy."

On Tuesday, China announced a series of retaliatory tariffs against the US. The Trump administration recently announced 25% tariffs on goods from both Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% levy on imports from China. However, President Donald Trump on Monday paused the announced tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month.

The index for current economic conditions decreased 7.2% sequentially to 68.7 in February, while the expectations measure fell 2.9% to 67.3. Expectations for personal finances dropped roughly 6%, its lowest value since October 2023, the survey showed.

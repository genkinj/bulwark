\*\* Shares of satellite operator SES are up 3.8%, set for second straight session of gains, amid expectations that it would sell spectrum again following the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's intention to introduce more spectrum into the market

\*\* FCC is set to reauction a large number of C-band spectrum licenses, including for commercial use, chairman Brendan Carr outlined in a letter published on the FCC website on Wednesday

\*\* "We do see there are spectrum monetisation options, as selling spectrum is discussed in the merger agreement between SES and Intelsat," ING analyst Jan Frederik Slijkerman says

\*\* He flags however that spectrum monetisation trajectories "often take a long time to materialise"

\*\* If gains hold, Luxembourg-based SES will hit its highest share price since November 7

\*\* The stock tops France's SBF 120 index

\*\* SES stock had gained 11% at Thursday's close

\*\* Shares are set for a combined two-day rise of nearly 16%

BREA, Calif., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Reborn Coffee Inc. , a leader in the specialty coffee market, today announced has entered into a securities purchase agreement and a common stock purchase agreement for up to a total of $60 million in financing commitments with Arena Investors, LP (“Arena”) and Arena Business Solutions Global SPC II, Ltd. (“ABS”).

Dawson James Securities, Inc. served as placement agent to Reborn Coffee.

The finalized financing structure includes:

* Up to $10 Million Debenture and Warrant Offering (the “Debenture Offering”) – Reborn Coffee has entered into a securities purchase agreement with Arena for the sale and issuance of up to $10 million in aggregate principal of 10% original issue discount secured convertible debentures for a purchase price of up to $9 million. Reborn Coffee anticipates closing on the transaction in four separate tranches. In connection with the debentures, Reborn Coffee will also issue warrants to purchase common stock equal to 20% of the total principal amount of the related debentures divided by 92.5% of the lowest daily VWAP of the common stock for the five trading days prior to the related closing.
* $50 Million Equity Line of Credit (“ELOC”) – Reborn Coffee also announced that it has entered into a purchase agreement establishing an equity line of credit with ABS, under which the Company will have the right, but not the obligation, to issue and sell ABS up to $50.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock from time to time, subject to certain conditions set forth therein.

Reborn Coffee intends to use the net proceeds from the Debenture Offering and the ELOC for working capital and general corporate purposes to support its future growth.

"Finalizing this definitive agreement marks a major milestone for Reborn Coffee. Arena’s confidence in our vision and execution strengthens our ability to scale rapidly, open flagship locations, and drive continued innovation. We believe this funding provides the financial foundation we need to elevate our brand and expand strategically across key markets," said Jay Kim, CEO of Reborn Coffee.

With this potential financing now in place, Reborn Coffee plans to accelerate its national expansion, focusing on flagship store openings, strengthening its retail presence, and introducing new product offerings tailored to meet evolving consumer demands. The Debenture Offering will provide immediate liquidity to undertake growth initiatives, while the ELOC provides long-term financial strength to support large-scale expansion efforts.

Additional details on the Debenture and the ELOC will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that Reborn Coffee intends to file with the SEC.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the shares of common stock, nor will there be any sale of the shares of common stock in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is not permitted.

Vodafone said it appointed Guillaume Boutin as chief executive of its investments and strategy unit.

The telecommunications company said Friday that Boutin--currently chief executive of the Belgian telecommunications operator Proximus--will succeed Serpil Timuray in May.

Boutin joined Proximus in 2017 and was appointed CEO in 2019, Vodafone said.

Timuray has decided to leave the company at the end of June to pursue external opportunities, the company said.

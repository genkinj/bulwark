Major European stock markets struggled for direction on Friday, with both the STOXX 50 and STOXX 600 hovering near the flatline after reaching fresh 25-year and record highs, respectively, in the previous session.

Investors continued to digest corporate earnings while awaiting the US jobs report for further clues on the Fed’s next policy moves.

Meanwhile, weaker-than-expected quarterly results from Amazon dampened market sentiment.

Healthcare, household goods, autos and oil and gas were the worst performing sectors while construction materials, retail, real estate and banks booked the biggest gains.

On the corporate front, L'Oreal sank almost 4% after posting the slowest quarterly sales growth since the pandemic.

Porsche was also down more than 6% after announcing impairments and 2025 sales guidance below forecasts.

Meanwhile, Banco Sabadell gained about 1% after reporting a 75% rise in Q4 net profit.

Considering the full week, the STOXX 50 is up 1.3% and the STOXX 600 added 0.9%.

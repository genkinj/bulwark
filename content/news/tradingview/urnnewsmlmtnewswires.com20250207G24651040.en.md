Fitch Ratings has raised the national insurer financial strength ratings of four Sri Lankan insurers, according to a Thursday release.

The upgrade reflects a similar action on Sri Lanka's sovereign rating and the recalibration of Fitch's national scale rating.

The upgraded insurers include Continental Insurance Lanka, People's Insurance, HNB Assurance, and HNB General Insurance.

The rating agency also maintained the ratings of three Sri Lankan insurers, including National Insurance Trust Fund Board, Co-operative Insurance, and Construction Guarantee Fund.

The recalibration considers shifts in the relative creditworthiness of the country's issuers following the sovereign upgrade, with the latter resulting in reduced investment and liquidity risks.

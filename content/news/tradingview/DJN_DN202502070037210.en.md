European natural-gas prices are on track to post weekly gains of nearly 3% driven by uncertainties on future supplies and a looming cold snap expected to further deplete stockpiles. The benchmark Dutch TTF is up 0.5% at 54.80 euros a megawatt hour in early trade, after breaking above 55 euros in the previous session. As of Wednesday, EU gas storage was 50.6% full--a level expected to make restocking a challenge ahead of next winter. Prices are also supported by investment funds maintaining bullish positions and Europe's increased need for liquefied natural gas volumes. "The market is desperately trying to attract sufficient LNG cargos, and the current price levels indicate a premium for LNG cargos to Europe compared to Asia," DNB Markets analysts say in a note.

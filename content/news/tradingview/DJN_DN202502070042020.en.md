L'Oreal's 2024 results were disappointing but not surprising, Bryan Garnier analyst Loic Morvan says in a research note. The French beauty giant booked sales of 43.48 billion euros in 2024, up 5.1% organically. This growth was less than that seen in 2023 and decelerated each quarter in the year, the analyst says. For 2025, Bryan Garnier expects L'Oreal's sales to grow 5% organically. Shares are down 3.7% at 340.15 euros. (andrea.figueras@wsj.com)

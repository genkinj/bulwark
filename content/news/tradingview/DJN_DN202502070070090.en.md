Shares in Pinterest jumped after the image-sharing platform's results gave investors comfort about the company's trajectory.

Pinterest's earnings missed expectations, but its monthly active users reached an all-time high, and the company gave higher-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter.

The stock jumped 19% after Friday's open. Shares were down about 18% in the last 12 months through Thursday.

Bernstein upgraded the stock to "outperform," on the back of the strong quarter. Jefferies analysts said Pinterest's engagement metrics were impressive, and its overall results bolstered the case for the company delivering consistent mid-to-high teens revenue growth.

The quarter in detail:

* Adjusted earnings were 56 cents a share, behind the 64 cents forecast by analysts, according to FactSet.
* Revenue rose 18% to $1.15 billion, topping expectations. Average revenue per person was $2.12.
* Monthly active users reached 553 million, beating forecasts.
* For the current quarter, Pinterest projects revenue of $837 million to $852 million. Analysts had forecast $836 million.

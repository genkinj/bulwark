France's CAC 40 index dipped to the 8,000 mark on Friday, retreating from a recent eight-month high, as investors digested to a mixed US jobs report.

While nonfarm payrolls grew by just 143,000 in January, well below December’s revised 307,000 and missing expectations of 170,000, the data still signaled resilience in the labor market.

The US unemployment rate fell to an eight-month low of 4%, while average hourly earnings surged 0.5%, the fastest pace since August and above forecasts.

On the corporate front, L’Oréal dropped 4% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q4 sales, weighed down by sluggish demand in China.

Pernod Ricard followed, slipping 3.5% after cutting its fiscal-year outlook, citing worsening trends in China and global trade tariff uncertainties.

On the upside, Vinci climbed 3.2% after posting stronger-than-expected full-year results, with Q4 revenue and H2 EBIT exceeding estimates.

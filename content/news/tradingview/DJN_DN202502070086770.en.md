Pinterest is using artificial intelligence to drive user engagement and ad targeting in a strategy that's similar to the one Meta Platforms has been excelling with so far, Oppenheimer analysts say in a research note. The social-media platform's AI tools have boosted both user engagement and returns for its advertisers, the analysts say. Weekly active users and monthly active users have improved. The company also boasts a better, older and more affluent audience than social-media competitor Snapchat, the analysts say. Pinterest surges 18% on higher-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter.(dean.seal@wsj.com)

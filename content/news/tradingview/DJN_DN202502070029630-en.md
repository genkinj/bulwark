A rise in German exports at the end of last year suggests a rush to trade ahead of looming tariffs and doesn't promise a rebound in the country's manufacturing, Carsten Brzeski at Dutch bank ING tells investors in a note. Exports from Europe's largest economy unexpectedly rose in December, figures show Friday. That is likely to be a result of front-loading ahead of the tariffs that U.S. President Trump has threatened to impose on goods imported from the EU, Brzeski says. Combined with separate data showing a slump in production, the structural weakness in the German economy, he says. "Industry has been and will remain a drag on German growth," Brzeski warns.

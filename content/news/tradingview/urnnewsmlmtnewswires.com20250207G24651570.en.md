RBC Capital Markets raised its estimates for TotalEnergies , as the company benefits from widening regional gas price spreads that are expected to continue boosting liquefied natural gas earnings into 2025.

The research firm said it increased its EPS estimates by 6% and 3% for 2025 and 2026, respectively, and reduced capital expenditure projections, following the French energy group's fourth-quarter 2024 results. Analysts also noted TotalEnergies' progress in reducing risks, improving financial metrics, and maintaining a disciplined approach to growth.

"TTE looks to have largely de-risked its upstream growth into 2025, while gas price spreads have moved from a headwind to tailwind for its LNG business," analysts said. "We continue to see the company leading on FCF growth over the coming years, while lower near term capex leaves the buyback coverage slightly higher than previously."

RBC reiterated its outperform rating, with a price target of 80 euros, adding that the company remains a recommended core holding for energy investors.

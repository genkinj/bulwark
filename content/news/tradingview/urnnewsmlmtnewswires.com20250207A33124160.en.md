Fennec Pharmaceuticals said Friday that Norgine Pharmaceuticals has commercially launched Pedmarqsi in Germany as part of a licensing deal forged last year between the two companies.

Under the terms of the deal, Fennec said it received an upfront payment of about $43 million and expects to receive up to approximately $230 million in milestone payments along with double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of the chemotherapy side effect treatment starting in the mid-teens and growing to the mid-twenties.

In exchange, Norgine has exclusive licensing rights for the drug, also called sodium thiosulfate, in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, the company said.

Porsche AG's new strategic measures are the premium car maker's last shot to prove it can turn around the business before losing more trust of long-term shareholders, Deutsche Bank analysts write. A volatile adjustment phase had been expected this year, the bank says. This is due to adjusting capacity to offset the China weakness, spending more on combustion engine cars again, increasing the customization share, and changing its leadership. "[Thursday] night, the company made a big step forward toward that; unfortunately also costing more than expected." Summing up all these measures, the company expects additional costs of 800 million euros in 2025 and said it is looking for flattish revenues, while the EBIT margin should decline to 10%-12% against consensus at 14%. Shares trade 5.5% lower at 56.58 euros. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

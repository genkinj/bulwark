US natural gas futures were slightly lower at $3.35/MMBtu on Friday but rose nearly 10% this week.

The increase was driven by higher LNG exports and colder weather forecasts, which are expected to boost heating demand.

Gas flows to LNG export plants also increased to 15.1 bcfd so far in February, up from 14.6 bcfd in January, nearing Decemberâ€™s record.

Looking ahead, meteorologists predict colder-than-normal weather through February 22, which will likely maintain high demand.

Extreme cold in January likely prompted record-level withdrawals from storage, potentially close to the all-time high of 994 bcf in January 2022.

On the production side, February gas output in the Lower 48 states has risen to 106.1 bcfd, up from 102.7 bcfd in January, though daily production is set to fall slightly.

The FTSE MIB was marginally down around 37,100 on Friday afternoon, but still hovering around January 2008 highs, in line with its regional peers.

The US labor market showed continued signs of resilience in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and wages grew more than expected, while job growth eased.

Meanwhile, traders continued to assess more corporate earnings.

On the corporate front, Bper Banca fell nearly 8% after launching a €4.3bn all-share bid for Banca Popolare di Sondrio.

Other financial stocks also declined, including Nexi (-4.1%), Recordati (-1.7%) and Finecobank (-3.2%).

Meanwhile, Iveco Group was the top performer, soaring more than 20% after reporting strong 2024 results and proposing a €0.33 per share dividend, reflecting confidence in its financial stability.

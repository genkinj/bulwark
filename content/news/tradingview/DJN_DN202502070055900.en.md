By Angel Au-Yeung

Shares of Affirm, a buy-now, pay-later loan provider, jumped 15% in premarket trading, after it reported results late Thursday.

The key numbers:

* Revenue came in at $866 million last quarter, well above analysts' estimates.
* Gross merchandise volume-a measure of the total value of transactions on the platform- topped $10 billion for the first time.
* Affirm had 21 million active consumers, a 23% increase from a year earlier.

Affirm is seeing healthy spending behaviors from customers, said Chief Executive Max Levchin. "They're doing well, which seems surprising to a bunch of people, although not us," he told The Wall Street Journal.

Travel remains a strong growth area for Affirm, and electronics are making a comeback after a dip following the busy pandemic period. Sporting goods and outdoor equipment dropped 10% in volume from a year earlier.

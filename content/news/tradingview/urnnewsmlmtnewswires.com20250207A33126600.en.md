RBC noted Friday that Canadian employment jumped 76k in January, building on the 91k jump in December and with "broadly firm underlying details". The unemployment rate edged down to 6.6%, down from 6.7% in December and 6.9% in November.

For RBC, the Bottom Line is that Canadian labour markets "surprised broadly on the upside" for a second straight month in January, with employment rising "solidly" and the unemployment rate unexpectedly slipping lower.

RBC said: "It is probably too early to give labour markets the all clear â€” the unemployment rate is still up almost a percentage point from a year ago and wage growth slowed to its lowest year-over-year rate since May 2022. But the unemployment rate may be closer to peaking (or have peaked) earlier than feared."

The Bank of Canada, RBC noted, signaled following the January rate cut that further reductions would be contingent on economic data continuing to look soft. So, RBC said, another round of firm looking labour market data reduces the urgency for the BoC to cut again in March. Still, it added, interest rates are at relatively high levels relative to a soft economic backdrop, household spending has shown signs of picking up, but business spending is still very soft. There remain significant risks that U.S. tariffs could be announced before the March policy meeting, and another round of labour market and inflation data still to be released before then, RBC noted.

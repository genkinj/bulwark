Nordic front-quarter prices fell on Friday as water reserves improved slightly, with the contract headed for weekly losses on forecasts for near-normal weather conditions at the end of the month.

\* By 1256 GMT, Nordic front-quarter baseload power contract (ENOFBLQc1) fell 0.15 euros to 25 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) and was on track for weekly loss of 2%.

\* Nordic front-year prices (ENOFBLYc1) remained unchanged at 36.85 euros per MWh, but were on track for a second straight week of gains.

\* "The new runs continue to show a stable high-pressure scenario over Europe... later in the period, the center of the high pressure could move northwestwards. This would leave Scandinavia under cold air influence, but potentially with some moderate weather activity in the second half of February," Georg Muller, a meteorologist at LSEG, said in a note.

\* Nordic water reserves available 15 days ahead (PCAEC00) were seen at 10.19 terawatt hours (TWh) above normal. Water reserves registered a modest rise compared with 9.86 TWh seen on Thursday and a two-month low of 9.61 reached on Wednesday.

\* "Ahead of the weekend, we still see quite dry, cold and calm weather conditions for the coming weeks in the Nordic area, but the most recent outlook does suggest that we could see the situation normalize at the end of week 8," analysts at Energi Danmark said in a note.

\* "This is a somewhat bearish signal for the Nordic power market."

\* In the European carbon market, the benchmark contract (CFI2Zc1) fell 0.11 euros to 81.82 euros a tonne, and was set to post weekly losses.

\* Dutch and British wholesale gas prices remained near 15-month highs on Friday morning as colder weather stoked demand and lower storage levels buoyed the market.

\* German year-ahead power (TRDEBYc1) remained unchanged at 99.3 euros per MWh.

\* The Nordic power price for next-day physical delivery (FXSYSAL=NPX), or system price, fell 7.07 euros to 42.24 euros per MWh.

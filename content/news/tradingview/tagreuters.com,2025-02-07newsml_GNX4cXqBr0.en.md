Lavish Entertainment, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Triangle Ventures operating under its Entertainment Division. Currently conducting its business out of Las Vegas, Nevada, the Company started doing business in 2017 and was established with a vision of becoming nationally recognized in concert production. The Company currently has more than 30,000 national followers and nearly 100 team members who have helped Lavish successfully organize some of the most exciting electronic dance music concerts in Las Vegas.

Lavish Entertainment is currently developing a flagship entertainment complex called Destino Ranch, which intends to become an ideal outdoor music and festival venue, immersive art installation, tourist attraction, and world-renowned destination center. The Company recently secured a purchase agreement to acquire nearly 70 acres of prime and improved land for its Destino Ranch project, which is strategically located in Arizona. The property secured has upgrades that represent a substantial investment totaling nearly $6 million, which has turned this once-vacant land into a beautiful oasis that provides the initial infrastructure needed to begin the development of Destino Ranch.

Lavish Entertainment’s revised model encompasses the following key foundational elements: logistics, staffing, equipment, and production. These pillars were meticulously identified and organized to complement each other and ensure seamless operations across all facets of the Company. To enhance its bandwidth and expand service offerings, Lavish Entertainment intends to develop and acquire operations in each of the four key areas.

**1. Logistics**: Effective logistics are crucial for any successful entertainment operation.

Supply of sterling-denominated corporate bonds has declined considerably in recent years as U.K. companies increasingly issue bonds in the dollar market, Barclays analysts say in a note. "A key drive of this has been the steady shift by U.K. corporates into the dollar investment-grade market, reducing their borrowing in the sterling investment-grade [market] over the last 10 years," Barclays says. Other regions have also reduced issuance in sterling, worsening the decline, they say. "Sterling issuance has been disappointing for several quarters, with 2024 gross supply ending the year at 52.2 billion pounds ($64.9 billion), far short of the 70 billion pounds we forecast at the beginning of the year," Barclays says.

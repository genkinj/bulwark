Malaysia's industrial output in December expanded by 4.6% on year, led by an upswing in manufacturing, the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) reported on Friday.

The nation's manufacturing output in December grew by 5.8% on year, mining output expanded by 0.4%, and electricity output rose by 3.9% on year.

In manufacturing, the December expansion was largely driven by export industries, reported the DOSM.

Export-oriented industrial output in Malaysia rose by 6.8% on year in the month, led by an 11.9% expansion in the production of rubber products, and a 10.1% rise in the output of computers, electronics, and optical products.

The output of domestic-oriented industries increased by 3.7% on year in December, added the DOSM.

For the fourth quarter, Malaysia's industrial output rose 3.4% on year, while for the full year 2024, the nation's industrial output rose 3.8% on year, added the DOSM.

Malaysia's industrial output should continue to improve in 2025, if recent government forecasts regarding the Malaysian economy are on target.

In January, the Malaysian Finance Ministry estimated the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) will expand by 4.5% to 5.5% in 2025, on par with 2024's trend, and that the manufacturing sector in 2025 will expand by 4.5% on year.

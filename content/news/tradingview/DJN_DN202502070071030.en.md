Converge Technology Solutions shares soared after it said it agreed to be acquired in a deal with an enterprise value of about 1.3 billion Canadian dollars ($908.7 million) by an affiliate of Florida-based H.I.G. Capital.

Shares traded over 53% higher at C$5.41.

Converge, a Toronto-based technology company, said its board unanimously approved the deal, and that shareholders representing about 24% of its outstanding shares have entered into voting support agreements in favor of the transaction.

The deal entails shareholders of the company receiving C$5.50 per share in cash, representing about a 56% premium to Thursday's closing price of C$3.53.

CHICAGO, Feb. 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full year.

"Cboe reported strong fourth quarter results, capping full year 2024 net revenue growth of 8% to a record $2.1 billion, diluted EPS of $7.21, and record adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $8.61, up 10% year-over-year," said Fredric Tomczyk, Cboe Global Markets Chief Executive Officer. "While the robust options volumes were a standout for 2024, the results were notable in that each category — Derivatives Markets, Data Vantage, and Cash and Spot Markets — contributed to the fourth quarter and full year growth. We enter 2025 on solid footing, with a refined strategic focus and the financial flexibility to execute on our vision. We remain well positioned to benefit from the secular market trends to drive durable growth for shareholders."

"In the fourth quarter, Cboe generated solid net revenues and earnings results to finish a record year," said Jill Griebenow, Cboe Global Markets Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. "Derivatives Markets net revenue was up 8% in 2024, driven by record volumes in our options business. Data Vantage net revenue grew 7% in 2024, and Cash and Spot Markets net revenue increased an impressive 10% for the full year. Following another record year of revenue generation, we anticipate organic total net revenue growth(2) will be in the mid single digit range in 2025. We anticipate Data Vantage organic net revenue growth(2) will be in the mid to high single digit range in 2025. Our revenue growth expectations are balanced by our disciplined expense focus, with the introduction of our full year adjusted operating expense guidance(2) range of $837 to $852 million. 2025 is off to a strong start, and we look forward to delivering on our objectives for shareholders in the year ahead."

(2)  Specific quantification of the amounts that would be required to   
     reconcile the company's organic net revenue growth guidance and adjusted   
     operating expenses guidance are not available. The company believes that   
     there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its   
     GAAP measures, primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and   
     costs that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of   
     revenues, GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which   
     preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain   
     forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes   
     that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to   
     reconcile the range of the company's organic net revenue growth guidance   
     and adjusted operating expenses would imply a degree of precision that   
     would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified

* Total revenues less cost of revenues (referred to as "net revenue"2) of $524.5 million increased 5 percent, compared to $499.0 million in the prior-year period, a result of increases in cash and spot markets, Data Vantage, and derivatives markets net revenue2.
* Total operating expenses were $226.0 million versus $205.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of $21.0 million. This increase was primarily due to the change in contingent consideration related to prior acquisitions and higher travel and promotional expenses, technology support services, and professional fees and outside services. Adjusted operating expenses1 of $204.8 million increased 7 percent compared to $191.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to higher travel and promotional expenses, technology support services, and professional fees and outside services.
* The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 29.7 percent as compared with 26.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The higher effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily due to tax benefits arising in 2023 from changes in contingent consideration and valuation allowance releases. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings1 was 29.5 percent, up 2.2 percentage points when compared with 27.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter. The change was primarily due to lower non-deductible compensation in 2023 resulting from executive changes.
* Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2024 decreased 6 percent to $1.86 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS1 of $2.10 increased 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

Discussion of Results by Business Segment(1) :

Options:

* Record Options net revenue of $324.3 million was up $9.8 million, or 3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2023. Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased primarily as a result of an 8 percent increase in multi-listed options trading volumes and multi-listed revenue per contract ("RPC") versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Market data fees increased 13 percent and access and capacity fees were 3 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2023.
* Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased $2.6 million, or 1 percent, reflecting a 5 percent increase in total options average daily volume ("ADV"), partially offset by a 5 percent decrease in total options RPC compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in total options RPC was due to a mix shift, with index options representing a lower percentage of total options volume.
* Cboe's Options exchanges had total market share of 30.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 33.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, a result of lower multi-listed market share as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

North American (N.A.) Equities:

* N.A. Equities net revenue of $94.9 million increased $8.6 million, or 10 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting higher net transaction and clearing fees2 and access and capacity fees, partially offset by a decline in industry market data fees.
* Net transaction and clearing fees2 increased by $6.4 million, or 28 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by stronger industry volumes as well as improved net capture rates for on-exchange U.S. Equities, partially offset by lower market share in on-exchange U.S. Equities and Canadian Equities as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.
* Cboe's U.S. Equities exchanges had market share of 10.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to 13.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 given higher industry off-exchange market share. Cboe's U.S. Equities off-exchange market share was 17.3 percent, down from 18.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. Canadian Equities market share decreased to 14.3 percent as compared to 15.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Europe and Asia Pacific (APAC):

* Europe and APAC net revenue of $56.2 million increased by 17 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, reflecting growth in net transaction and clearing fees2 and non-transaction revenues. On a constant currency basis3, net revenues were $56.0 million, up 17 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. European Equities average daily notional value ("ADNV") traded on Cboe European Equities was EUR10.4 billion, up 15 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 given a 12 percent increase in industry market volumes. Japanese Equities ADNV was 39 percent higher and Australian Equities ADNV was 9 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2023.
* For the fourth quarter of 2024, Cboe European Equities had 24.6 percent market share, up from 23.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cboe European Equities net capture rate increased 12 percent given a mix shift to higher capture products. Cboe Australia had 20.8 percent market share for the fourth quarter of 2024, up from 20.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cboe Japan grew market share to 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024 from 4.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Futures:

* Futures net revenue of $30.2 million decreased $2.2 million, or 7 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2023 due to a decrease in net transaction and clearing fees2.
* Net transaction and clearing fees2 decreased $2.2 million, reflecting a 12 percent decline in ADV during the quarter.

Global FX:

* Global FX net revenue of $19.4 million increased 3 percent due to higher net transaction and clearing fees2. Net capture rate per one million dollars traded was $2.72 for the quarter, up 5 percent compared to $2.60 in the fourth quarter of 2023, and ADNV traded on the Cboe FX platform was $45.6 billion for the quarter, down 3 percent compared to last year's fourth quarter.
* Cboe FX market share was 19.0 percent for the quarter compared to 21.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter.

2025 Fiscal Year Financial Guidance

Cboe provided guidance for the 2025 fiscal year as noted below.

* Organic total net revenue growth1 is expected to be in the mid single digit range in 2025.
* Organic net revenue growth1 from Data Vantage is expected to be in the mid to high single digit range in 2025.
* Adjusted operating expenses1 in 2025 are expected to be in the range of $837 to $852 million. The guidance excludes the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets of $70 million; the company adjusts for this amount in its non-GAAP reconciliation.
* Depreciation and amortization expense for 2025 is expected to be in the range of $55 to $59 million, excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.
* The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings1 for the full year 2025 is expected to be in the range of 28.5 to 30.5 percent. Significant changes in trading volume, expenses, tax laws or rates and other items could materially impact this expectation.
* Capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be in the range of $75 to $85 million.

```
(1)  Specific quantification of the amounts that would be required to   
     reconcile the company's organic and inorganic growth guidance, adjusted   
     operating expenses guidance, annualized adjusted operating expenses   
     guidance, and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings guidance are   
     not available. Acquisitions are considered organic after 12 months of   
     closing. The company believes that there is uncertainty and   
     unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures, primarily   
     related to acquisition-related revenues and costs that would be required   
     to reconcile to GAAP revenues less cost of revenues, GAAP operating   
     expenses and GAAP effective tax rate, which preclude the company from   
     providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP   
     reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the   
     amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's   
     organic growth, adjusted operating expenses, annualized adjusted   
     operating expenses, and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would   
     imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to   
     investors for the reasons identified above.

Non-GAAP Information

In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with GAAP, Cboe Global Markets has disclosed certain non-GAAP measures of operating performance. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include adjusted revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, effective tax rate on adjusted earnings, adjusted cash, net revenues in constant currency, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin.

Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.

Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.

Acquisition-related costs: From time to time, we have pursued acquisitions, which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence, impairment charges, and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing, and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.

The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.

EBITDA Reconciliations

EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related costs, change in contingent consideration, loss on investments, gain on sale of property held for sale, costs related to the Cboe Digital wind down, gain on Cboe Digital non-recourse notes and warrants wind down, impairment of intangible assets, contra-revenue associated with the Cboe Digital syndication wind down, and income from investment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income, as an indicator of the company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.

Finnair will begin on Feb. 12 change negotiations for the possible reduction or furlough of up to 90 pilots as the ongoing strikes put the Finnish flag carrier's so-called wet lease deal at risk, according to a Friday release.

The talks will also include a plan to add the stand-by practice to the employment contracts of pilots after the pilot union refused to collectively agree on stand-by duty.

Finnair signed the wet lease agreement with Qantas for two of its A330 aircraft in 2023, according to previous media reports.

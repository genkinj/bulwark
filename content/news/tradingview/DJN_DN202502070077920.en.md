Canada's labor market continued to create jobs at a torrid pace last month, with President Trump's tariff threats not holding back hiring despite signs emerging trade uncertainty is starting to weigh on business plans in the country, Oxford Economics' Tony Stillo and Michael Davenport say. The pair expect targeted U.S. tariffs and a proportional response from Canada this spring, which will drag on employment growth in affected areas and lift the jobless rate north of 7% later in the year. And recent job growth aside, the economists see ample slack in the economy and below-target inflation allowing for three more quarter-point rate cuts in 2025.(robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

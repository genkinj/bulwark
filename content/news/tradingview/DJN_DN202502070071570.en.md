CBOT grains are opening trading lower, as analysts say that the forward momentum of grains this week — closing higher for 3 out of the past 4 sessions — appears to be sapped. "The bulls may need another push to keep momentum moving forward, but may have trouble finding one this month," says Matt Zeller of StoneX in a note. Tuesday's WASDE report is expected to contain little in the way of new information on U.S. crops, although updates to the USDA's outlook for Brazil and Argentina are expected. Some analysts are mulling the possibility of the USDA adjusting export forecasts for U.S. grains, although recent trade uncertainty may stifle that. Most-active corn is down 1% early, soybeans fall 0.8%, and wheat slides 1.1%. (kirk.maltais@wsj.com)

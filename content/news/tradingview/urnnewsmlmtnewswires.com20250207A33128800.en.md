Apple was ordered by the UK government to build a backdoor to give it access to global user data, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The UK authorities asked Apple in an undisclosed order in January to circumvent encryption the tech giant uses to secure user data stored in its cloud services, the person reportedly told Bloomberg.

Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment from MT Newswires.

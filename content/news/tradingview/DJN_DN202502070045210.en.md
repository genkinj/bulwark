Supply of new euro-denominated corporate bonds remained strong in January reaching a total volume of 37.2 billion euros ($38.6 billion), following strong issuance in 2024, LBBW's Matthias Schell says in a note. "Companies took advantage of the positive market environment at the beginning of the year to issue 8 subordinated hybrid bonds, which accounted for a high share of 15% of the January volume," Schell says. Strong demand for new issues also encouraged corporates to issue new bonds, he says. "On average, investors subscribed four times the volume subsequently placed." (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)

Angolan crude oil differentials remained well supported on Friday by solid demand, with one buyer of a cargo heard to be re-offering it into the market.

\* Equinor was offering a cargo of Angolan CLOV at dated Brent plus $3.75 this week, and sold the cargo to Chevron which is re-offering the crude, a trader said.

\* The pace of trade for Angola's March loading schedule has been helped along by strong demand from Indian buyers in particular, as well as Chinese refiners, one trade source said.

\* Indian and Chinese buyers turned to West African crude, as well as other grades, as they sought alternatives to Russian supply after the U.S. announced sanctions targeting Russian producers and tankers in January.

\* Nonetheless, sources said earlier this week 11-12 cargoes remained available from Angola's March schedule and demand was petering out.

\* On Nigerian crude, no change was heard on Friday in offer levels. Forcados was last heard on offer at dated Brent plus $3.90 a barrel, while Nigerian Bonny Light was offered at dated Brent plus $1.90 a barrel.

US stocks reversed early gains and fell into negative territory on Friday, with the S&P 500 dropping 0.2%, the Dow Jones losing about 80 points and the Nasdaq declining 0.6%, with traders digesting key economic data.

The Michigan Consumer Sentiment unexpectedly dropped and inflation expectations for the year ahead soared.

Also, the jobs report continued to point to a solid labour market, supporting the Fedâ€™s stance to keep interest rates steady for now.

Payroll growth came in well below expectations at 143K but the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4%, and wage growth accelerated to 0.5%.

Meanwhile, shares of Amazon lost more than 3% after the company projected Q1 revenue growth of 5% to 9%, which would mark its slowest growth rate on record.

Consumer discretionary and communication services were the worst performing sectors while the energy sector outperformed.

Considering the full week, the S&P 500 is up 0.7%, the Nasdaq added 0.8% and the Dow Jones gained 0.5% so far.

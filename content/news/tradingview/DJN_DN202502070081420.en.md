**(17:04 GMT)** Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Builds $2.3 Billion Stake in Uber

By Sabela Ojea

Bill Ackman has amassed a roughly $2.3 billion stake in Uber, saying in a post on X that the ride-hailing company's stock is undervalued.

Ackman said Friday in the post that his Pershing Square investment fund began acquiring a position in Uber in early January and now owns 30.3 million shares.

"We believe that Uber is one of the best managed and highest quality businesses in the world," Ackman said on a post on X. "Remarkably, it can still be purchased at a massive discount to its intrinsic value," he added.

He praised the management of Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, nothing that under his tenure the company has become highly profitable and is generating a ton of cash.

Uber and Pershing Square weren't immediately available for comment.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index hovered just above the flatline at 25,535 on Friday, as gains in commodity producers outweighed broader risk aversion amid reduced pressure on the Bank of Canada to extend easing monetary policy.

Teck Resources led the advance, with shares rising over 3%, while the energy sector, buoyed by rising oil prices, saw heavyweights like Suncor and Imperial Oil outperform.

Broader gains were tempered after Canadaâ€™s unemployment rate, which fell to 6.6% in January from 6.7% in December, eased concerns about labor market weakness flagged by the BoC. Canadian Pacific Railway, BMO, and Canadian National Railway were among the top laggards, losing between 0.7% and 1.1%.

Additionally, a lower-than-expected US unemployment figure gave the Federal Reserve room to delay further rate cuts, adding pressure to risk assets.

The TSX was poised for a flat weekly performance, recovering from an earlier plunge triggered by US tariffs, now delayed until March.

Issuance of new euro-denominated corporate bonds is expected to remain heavy this year, LBBW senior credit strategist Matthias Schell says in a note. "We anticipate a slight increase in the volume of new issues to 450 billion euros ($467.3 billion)," he says. A high volume of euro corporate bonds--amounting to 370 billion euros--are maturing in 2026. This could push companies to issue new bonds ahead of the maturities, Schell says.

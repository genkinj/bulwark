Endeavour Silver on Friday said its capital expenditures for the Terronera project in Mexico increased to US$332 million from the initial estimate of US$271 million outlined in 2024.

In its updated 2025 project scenario, the company attributed the increase to higher mining costs due to extended project schedule and increased waste rock disposal costs.

Endeavour also flagged cost increases related to the mineral process plant, site infrastructure and other indirect costs.

Endeavour Silver said the project is nearly 89.4% complete as of Dec. 31, and expects to begin full system commissioning in early second quarter.

"Endeavour Silver's Terronera project is nearing completion," COO Don Gray said. "We're focused on maintaining our construction schedule and momentum to have Terronera ready for full commissioning in early Q2Â 2025."

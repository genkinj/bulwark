Indian government bond yields ended higher on Friday, as investors were disappointed that the central bank's first rate cut in nearly five years was not accompanied with any additional steps to boost banking system liquidity.

The benchmark 10-year yield (IN067934G=CC) ended at 6.7043% compared with its previous close of 6.6562%.

The Reserve Bank of India cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points as it seeks to boost the sluggish economy and sees inflation easing towards its 4% target. The decision was in line with a Reuters poll.

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the central bank will continue to monitor the evolving liquidity and financial market conditions and proactively take appropriate measures to ensure orderly liquidity conditions, but did not announce measures.

Bond yields rose due to heavy positioning of traders in anticipation of favourable measures along with the repo rate cut, which did not materialise, said Murthy Nagarajan, head of fixed income at Tata Asset Management.

"This is a knee-jerk reaction as RBI is expected to support growth through liquidity and rate cut measures in the coming months as global uncertainty comes down," he said.

In January, the RBI bought bonds worth 588.35 billion rupees ($6.73 billion) and infused 440 billion rupees through dollar/rupee swaps.

Some market participants had expected a cut in banks' cash reserve ratio, or other measures, but none of these materialised.

IDFC First Bank estimates that the central bank will need to infuse an additional 3 trillion rupees in this financial year to ensure that banking system liquidity becomes mildly positive, over and above the infusion that it has already announced.

($1 = 87.4100 Indian rupees)

Besides the headline jobs gain, the most notable item in Canada's employment data for January is the deceleration in average hourly wages, says market-research firm Rosenberg Research. "If the labor market was tight to any degree, compensation would not be moderating at all, let alone to this extent," says firm founder David Rosenberg and economist Robert Embree. Annual hourly wage increases slow to 3.5% as of January, from a recent peak of 4.9% in October. Rosenberg contends President Trump is unlikely to slap hefty tariffs on Canadian imports, but the uncertainty stemming from Trump's policy direction will lead to slower business investment and hiring. The firm still expect 4 or more cuts in 2025, even without Trump tariffs. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

Cadeler said Friday it signed a vessel reservation agreement with Ocean Winds for the installation and transportation of 30 wind turbine generators at the BC-Wind offshore wind farm in the Polish Baltic Sea.

The Danish offshore wind services company said the value of the contract will be negotiated and is estimated to be between 48 million euros and 56 million euros.

The 500-megawatt BC-Wind project is Ocean Winds' first one in Poland.

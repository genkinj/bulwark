Swiss stocks broke their rally on Friday, with the Swiss Market Index concluding the trading week 0.24% in the red.

Government data showed that Switzerland's consumer sentiment index stood at -29.3 points in January, compared with -30.3 points in the previous month and the consensus estimates of -31 points.

Meanwhile, the country's foreign currency reserves climbed to 736.39 billion francs in January from 730.87 billion francs a month before, Swiss National Bank data showed.

Across the pond, total nonfarm payroll employment in the US increased by 143,000 in January, compared with the upwardly revised 307,000 in the prior month and market forecasts of 170,000. On the other hand, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4% from 4.1%.

"A respectable outcome for January job creation with fewer than feared downward revisions to historical data have cemented expectations that the Fed will not be cutting rates imminently," ING said. "There are still lingering concerns about the quality of jobs being added, but an improving trend in jobs creation since late summer means the Fed will hold rates until 3Q."

On the corporate side, investment manager Vontobel , electrical measurement company Lem and polymer and specialty chemicals group Ems-Chemie were among Swiss companies that reported earnings results.

Ems-Chemie shed 2.55% amid expectations that net sales in 2025 would be lower than in 2024 due to currency effects. The group reported a 5.4% year-over-year drop in 2024 net sales to 2.07 billion francs from 2.19 billion francs, impacted by weaker foreign currencies, while net income edged up 1% to 466 million francs.

In contrast, Leclanché shares surged 14.83% following its announcement that Pinnacle International Capital completed the legal, financial and technical due diligence of the Swiss battery manufacturing group, paving the way for a strategic partnership between the parties. The partnership involves a 50/50 joint venture focused on expanding Leclanché's battery production capabilities in Germany and the Middle East.

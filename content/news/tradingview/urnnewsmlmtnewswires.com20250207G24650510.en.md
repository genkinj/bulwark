Novo Nordisk (NOVO-B.CO) said Friday that Mim8 was well-tolerated and efficacious in children with hemophilia A, a hereditary bleeding disorder, according to interim trial results.

The phase 3 Frontier3 trial involved 70 children aged one to 11 years with hemophilia A with and without inhibitors. The trial initially evaluated once-weekly prophylaxis treatment with investigational Mim8 and gave participants the option to switch to once-monthly dosing after 26 weeks.

Novo Nordisk expects regulatory submission for Mim8 in 2025.

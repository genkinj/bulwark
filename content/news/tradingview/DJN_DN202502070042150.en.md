Wizz Air's unit revenue will likely be supported by demand growth in Eastern Europe, HSBC analyst Ruxandra Haradau-Doeser says in a research note. The International Monetary Fund expects GDP growth in the region to outperform overall European trends, she says. The low-cost airline's plans to add capacity to its network will allow it to improve market awareness, attract more corporate passengers and secure attractive slots at its main airports, Haradau-Doeser says. As capacity and the frequency of flights increase, Wizz Air should be able to lower airport charges, raise asset utilization and crew productivity, the analyst says. Shares trade flat at 14.97 pounds. (pierre.bertrand@wsj.com)

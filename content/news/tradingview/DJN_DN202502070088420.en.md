Newell Brands lost more than a quarter of its market value after the company behind Crock-Pot, Mr. Coffee and Elmer's glue forecast a drop in sales this year and a wider-than-expected loss in the current quarter.

The Atlanta consumer-goods company Friday said it expects 2025 sales to slip by 2% to 4%, and projects an adjusted loss--which strips out certain one-time items--of 6 to 9 cents in the current quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast roughly flat sales from last year, and a first-quarter adjusted profit of 3 cents a share.

The company said it expected sales to decline this year as lower-income consumers remain under pressure from the past years' inflation, and as the dollar has strengthened and tax, tariff and trade policies in the U.S. are fluid. In response, Newell said it planned to progress with its turnaround plan and would launch and invest in more mid- and high-price products across its business.

"While much work remains and the macroeconomic backdrop is still uncertain, we are laser focused on returning the company to sustainable top line growth," Chief Executive Chris Peterson said on a call with analysts.

Shares of Newell, whose brands also include Sharpie pens, Rubbermaid storage products and Marmot outdoor gear, at midday were down 28% at $6.95, on track for their biggest-ever single-day percentage drop. The stock is down 40% from its 52-week high hit in December, yet remains up about 2% from a year ago.

For the first quarter, the company expects a 5% to 8% decline in sales, a bigger drop than the 3.4% decrease forecasts by analysts.

The company also said it expected its adjusted earnings for the full year to come in at 70 cents to 76 cents a share. Analysts had been projecting 75 cents a share.

Truist analyst Bill Chappell noted that the company's management expected a positive sales inflection in the second half of the year, bolstering the firm's belief that organic growth is coming. He added that Newell might be a beneficiary from new tariffs, because of its relatively low exposure to China.

The outlook came as the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $54 million, or 13 cents a share, narrowing than the loss of $86 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.

In the last three months of 2024, gross margin widened on productivity savings and higher prices, which more than offset lower sales volumes, inflation and the stronger dollar.

Stripping out restructuring costs and other one-time items, adjusted earnings were 16 cents a share, beating analysts' average forecast for 14 cents a share. Fourth-quarter sales fell 6.1% to $1.95 billion, just below analyst forecasts for $1.96 billion.

Core sales, an adjusted revenue metric, were down 3%. Unfavorable foreign -currency translation and business exits accounted for the rest of the shortfall.

Newell said it priced products in its international markets to offset inflation and currency movements, which supported the company's core sales.

Europe's STOXX 50 index slipped 0.3% to 5,340 on Friday, retreating from a recent record high, as weaker-than-expected US jobs data weighed on sentiment.

The latest report showed the US economy added just 143,000 jobs in January, sharply lower than December’s 307,000 and missing market expectations of 170,000.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate edged down to 4%, slightly below forecasts, while wage growth accelerated to 0.5%, surpassing estimates of 0.3%.

On the corporate front, L’Oréal tumbled more than 4% after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth since the pandemic.

Porsche also slumped nearly 6% following impairment announcements and a 2025 sales outlook that fell short of expectations.

Meanwhile, Banco Sabadell shed about 1% despite posting a strong 75% surge in Q4 net profit.

Gold held above the $2,860 mark on Friday, remaining near the record highs touched this week amid growing expectations that major central banks will loosen monetary policy this year.

Rate futures indicated that investors still expect the Fed to deliver two rate cuts this year despite evidence of a strong labor market, aligning with the last projections by FOMC members.

Also, the Bank of England delivered a rate cut and with more dovish than expected vote tallies, while the RBI delivered its first rate cut since the measure to respond to the pandemic nearly five years ago.

Previously, the ECB and the BoC lowered rates with the latter ending quantitative tightening.

In turn, bullion assets were also supported by higher demand for safety amid the likelihood that China will follow through on tariffs against the US next week, and US President Trumpâ€™s threat of mobilizing residents of the Gaza Strip.

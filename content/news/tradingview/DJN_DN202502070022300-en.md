**(07:23 GMT)** Legal & General to Sell U.S. Protection Business in $2.3 Billion Deal

By Ian Walker

Legal & General Group is selling its U.S. protection business to long-term partner Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance in a deal that values the unit at $2.3 billion.

The FTSE 100-listed insurance company said Friday that it expects to return an extra 1.0 billion pounds ($1.24 billion) to shareholders via buybacks upon completion of the deal. It added that the board expects to return 40% of its market capitalization to shareholders through 2027 via a combination of dividends and buybacks.

The company had a market capitalization of 14.08 billion pounds based on its closing share price of 238.90 pence on Thursday.

As part of the deal, Meiji Yasuda will buy a 5% shareholding in the company and build on its existing partnership with L&G in asset management, the company said.

The stake reflects Meiji Yasuda's confidence in L&G's leadership, strategy and long-term prospects, Meiji Yasuda Chief Executive Hideki Nagashima said.

ANDOVER, Mass., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — **Byrna Technologies Inc.** **(“Byrna” or the “Company”)** , a personal defense technology company specializing in the development, manufacture, and sale of innovative less-lethal personal security solutions, today reported select financial results for its fiscal fourth quarter (“Q4 2024”) and full year ended November 30, 2024.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights

* Surpassed 500,000 launchers sold since inception, just five and a half years after the sale of Byrna’s first launcher in June 2019.
* Increased launcher production in the first fiscal quarter of 2025 by 33% to 24,000 launchers a month to meet growing market demand and support operational growth.
* Recently opened a new U.S.-based ammunition manufacturing facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana, as part of a re-shoring initiative, significantly expanding Byrna’s domestic production capacity and enhancing the Company’s supply chain for its payload ammunition.
* Continued to generate a highly accretive return on ad spend (ROAS) above 5.0X through the celebrity endorsement program for the full year 2024 period, leading to a record $28.0 million of sales for the fourth quarter of 2024.
* Added Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk, and Lara Trump as celebrity influencers to continue amplifying brand awareness and further support the normalization of its less-lethal solutions, while continuing to optimize marketing spend for maximum impact.
* Partnered with the United States Concealed Carry Association (USCCA), gaining access to nearly one million USCCA members to promote less-lethal solutions while introducing Byrna customers to USCCA’s training, education, and self-defense liability insurance offerings.
* Opened retail stores in the Greater Nashville Area, Scottsdale, Arizona, and Salem, New Hampshire. Byrna plans to open the Fort Wayne, Indiana store in the coming months.
* Signed a Letter of Intent to launch a pilot store-within-a-store program at eleven Sportsman’s Warehouse locations, expanding Byrna’s retail footprint.

**Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results**

Results compare Q4 2024 to the 2023 fiscal fourth quarter ended November 30, 2023 unless otherwise indicated.

**Net revenue** for Q4 2024 was $28.0 million, compared to $15.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023 (“Q4 2023”). The 79% year-over-year increase was primarily due to the transformational shift in Byrna’s advertising strategy implemented in September 2023 and the resulting normalization of Byrna and the less-lethal space generally.

**Gross profit** for Q4 2024 was $17.6 million (63% of net revenue), up from $9.0 million (58% of net revenue) in Q4 2023. The increase in gross profit was driven by the increase in the proportion of sales made through the high-margin direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels (Byrna.com and Amazon.com), a reduction in component costs driven through an intensive cost reduction effort focused on “design for manufacturability” spearheaded by Byrna’s engineering team, and the economies of scale resulting from increased production volumes.

**Operating expenses** for Q4 2024 were $13.5 million, compared to $9.7 million for Q4 2023, an increase of 39%. The increase in operating expenses was driven by an increase in variable selling costs (such as freight and third-party processing fees), increased marketing spend tied to the Company’s celebrity endorsement strategy, and higher payroll expenses in marketing and engineering as the Company has scaled to handle increased sales and production volumes.

**Net income** for Q4 2024 was $9.7 million, compared to a net loss of ($0.8) million for Q4 2023, a $10.5 million improvement. This increase was driven by higher revenue and a $5.6 million income tax benefit. The tax benefit arose from the release of tax valuation allowances related to net operating loss carryforwards incurred in earlier years and other tax assets.

**Adjusted EBITDA****1**, a non-GAAP metric reconciled below, for Q4 2024 totaled $5.2 million, compared to $0.4 million in Q4 2023.

**Cash and cash equivalents** at November 30, 2024 totaled $16.8 million compared to $20.5 million at November 30, 2023. The change in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an $8.9 million investment in short-term marketable securities to earn a higher yield on Byrna’s unused cash. Adding cash and short-term marketable securities, total funds available were $25.7 million, an increase of $5.2 million compared to November 30, 2023. Inventory at November 30, 2024 totaled $20.0 million compared to $13.9 million at November 30, 2023. The Company has no current or long-term debt.

**Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results**Results compare the 2024 fiscal year ended November 30, 2024 to the 2023 fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 unless otherwise indicated.

**Net revenue** for FY 2024 was $85.8 million, a 101% increase from $42.6 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 (“FY 2023”), driven by the Company’s strategic shift in advertising, increased brand normalization, and higher DTC sales

**Gross profit** for FY 2024 was $52.8 million (62% of net revenue), compared to $23.6 million (56% of net revenue) for FY 2023. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to a greater proportion of sales through high-margin DTC channels, lower component costs, and economies of scale.

**Operating expenses** for FY 2024 were $46.1 million, compared to $31.4 million for FY 2023, reflecting a 47% increase to support growth. The increase was driven by higher variable selling costs, expanded marketing efforts, and additional personnel in marketing and engineering.

**Net income** for FY 2024 was $12.8 million, compared to a net loss of ($8.2) million for FY 2023, a $21.0 million improvement. The increase in net income was driven by higher revenue and included a $5.7 million income tax benefit due to the full release of U.S. tax valuation allowances.

**Adjusted EBITDA****1** for FY 2024 totaled $11.5 million, compared to a negative ($2.0) million for FY 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to an increase in revenue.

**Management Commentary**

Byrna CEO Bryan Ganz stated: “The fourth quarter was the culmination of a remarkable year for Byrna. We successfully generated a record $28.0 million in revenue while also expanding our gross margins to 62.8%. This success allowed us to deliver a 101% increase in revenue from the full year 2023 to 2024 and underscores the overall growth in brand recognition and normalization of the less-lethal space.

“Our marketing strategy, anchored by the continued success of our celebrity influencer program, has continued to be instrumental in driving DTC sales and expanding brand awareness. For 2024, the program maintained a highly accretive return on ad spend (ROAS) above 5.0X, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach in normalizing less-lethal solutions. Building on this foundation, we have been adding a more robust, multi-channel marketing strategy that now includes traditional media such as cable and broadcast networks. This diversification complements our influencer program, which recently welcomed prominent voices like Megyn Kelly, Charlie Kirk, and Lara Trump.

As we execute across multiple channels, we will continue to be disciplined in evaluating partnerships and optimizing ad spend to maximize impact and ROAS. We have prioritized celebrity endorsers who demonstrate strong ROAS and have discontinued partnerships that did not meet our minimum ROAS requirements. To date, the celebrity endorsers who were initially successful have continued to perform well, while those we discontinued never met our ROAS benchmarks. Unfortunately, we did lose one very successful celebrity endorser, Governor Mike Huckabee, due to his appointment as U.S. ambassador to Israel.

“In addition to expanding our online DTC reach, we are making strides in building our brick-and-mortar footprint. With four company-owned stores up and running, we are optimistic that these stores will validate the company-owned store model and open the way to a rollout of Byrna company-owned stores in key markets throughout the United States. Given the high gross margins and the relatively inexpensive operating costs, we believe that these stores can contribute meaningfully to Byrna’s bottom line as they ramp up over the coming quarters. We are also pleased to announce that we have signed a letter of intent to partner with Sportsman’s Warehouse to launch a store-within-a-store model at 11 locations across the United States. Each of these Sportsman’s Warehouse locations will convert their existing archery range into a firing range for customers to experience our launchers, similar to our company-owned stores and premier dealers. If the initial pilot program is successful, Byrna expects to be in 90 more stores by the end of the year, accelerating the rate of our brick-and-mortar presence across the United States.

“To ensure our production keeps pace with our growth initiatives, we have successfully increased launcher production to 24,000 units as of January at our Fort Wayne, Indiana launcher production facility. Additionally, we have begun producing payload ammunition at a new facility in Fort Wayne, located four miles from our launcher production facility. This state-of-the-art manufacturing facility will house eight advanced dousing and welding machines capable of producing both .68 and .61 caliber payload rounds for our existing launchers as well as our anticipated new Compact Launcher. We will also be able to produce .61 caliber fin-tail payload rounds for our Pepper and Max 12-gauge less-lethal rounds. Once fully operational later this year, these eight machines will collectively produce up to 10 million rounds per month, including 1.5 million fin-tail rounds for the 12-gauge platform. We believe the combination of Byrna Pepper and Max 12-gauge rounds, coupled with the Sportsman’s “store-within-a-store” partnership, will help spur the sale of our less-lethal 12-gauge rounds.

The onshoring of ammunition production is part of Byrna’s larger ‘Made in America’ strategy. We remain committed to exiting China by mid-year and aim to source nearly 100% of the components for the Byrna SD, LE, and CL models from U.S. suppliers by the end of 2025. We expect that this transition will insulate us from any potential tariffs, create well-paying jobs for American workers, reduce lead times, and eliminate the risks associated with unreliable foreign suppliers. We expect it will also allow us to market the Byrna as ‘Made in America!’

“Our momentum has carried into the new fiscal year with a strong holiday season in December, including $1.4 million in total product sales on Cyber Monday alone. International adoption has also been robust, particularly in Argentina, where the Cordoba Province committed to purchasing 1.7 million rounds of payload ammunition. This order, which will be shipped in 200,000-round monthly increments through the balance of 2025, reflects the extensive deployment of the 13,500 Byrna launchers purchased by the Cordoba Police Department to apprehend dangerous criminals and maintain the peace.

“Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our trajectory. The ongoing success of our marketing efforts has resulted in less-lethal becoming a much more widely accepted personal self-defense category. This is allowing us to advertise on an increasing number of cable and social media platforms. We believe that the market for less-lethal weapons among gun owners in the U.S. is in the tens of millions of consumers. This expanding market, along with our growing online presence, expanding retail presence, and increasing international opportunities, reinforces our confidence in the long-term demand for less-lethal weapons as a whole and for Byrna specifically. While the first quarter historically experiences a seasonal slowdown in consumer spending, we expect to achieve strong year-over-year growth as we continue executing our strategic initiatives. We believe that Byrna is well-positioned to generate additional cash and expand profitability in 2025 and beyond.”

***Non-GAAP Financial Measures***

In addition to providing financial measurements based on generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we provide an additional financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP (non-GAAP) with presenting non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for financial and operational decision making, for planning and forecasting purposes and to evaluate our financial performance. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure helps us to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of certain expenses that we exclude in the calculations of the non-GAAP financial measure.

Accordingly, we believe that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the business and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects.

This non-GAAP financial measure does not replace the presentation of our GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations in the use of non-GAAP measures, because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment concerning exclusions of items from the comparable non-GAAP financial measure. In addition, other companies may use other non-GAAP measures to evaluate their performance, or may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measure as a tool for comparison.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income excluding the impact of (I) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income tax provision (benefit); (iii) interest income (expense); (iv) stock-based compensation expense, (v) impairment loss, and (vi) one time, non-recurring other expenses or income. Our Adjusted EBITDA measure eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting finance costs), tax positions, the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense). We also exclude certain one-time and non-cash costs. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows (in thousands):

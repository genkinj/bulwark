Private investment industry group American Investment Council suggested on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump should not close a loophole that allows private equity and hedge fund financiers to pay a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income.

"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities," AIC President Drew Maloney said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday that Trump had laid out his tax priorities, including closing the so-called carried interest tax loophole.

A change in the tax rule, which would affect the compensation of private funds managers, has been discussed for more than a decade.

Maloney said that since Trump's 2017 tax overhaul, the private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy and supported 36,000 small businesses.

In 2021, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that closing the loophole would raise tax revenue by $14 billion over ten years.

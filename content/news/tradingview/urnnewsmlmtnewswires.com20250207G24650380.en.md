Japan's official leading and coincident indicators of economic activity edged higher in December, although a government synopsis indicated caution on the economy.

Japan's leading economic indicators index, which incorporates such metrics as job offers and consumer sentiment, increased to 108.9 in December from 107.8 in November, reported the Cabinet Office.

The leading index nudged higher due to stronger household spending and a modestly declining unemployment rate.

The nation's coincident economic indicators index, which measures factory output, employment, retail sales, and other indicators, rose to 116.8 in December from 115.4 in November, added the Cabinet Office.

The leading index nudged higher due to stronger household spending and a modestly declining unemployment rate.

In its description of the December coincident index, the Cabinet Office said it pointed to an economy in a "halting to fall" stage, the same summary sentence the office has used since May.

Better times are ahead for Japan's economy if recent outlooks from the nation's central bank are accurate.

In a forecast released in late January, the Bank of Japan estimated that the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) would expand by a real 1.1% in fiscal 2025 started on April 1, after having expanded by a modest 0.5% in fiscal 2024.

Germany's trade surplus increased to EUR 20.7 billion in December 2024 from a downwardly revised EUR 19.2 billion in November, surpassing forecasts of EUR 17 billion, marking the largest trade surplus since August. Exports unexpectedly grew by 2.9% mom to an eight-month high of EUR 131.7 billion in December 2024, beating estimates of a 0.6% fall, after a downwardly revised 2.3% increase in November.

It marked the 2nd straight month of growth in exports and the fastest pace since January 2024, boosted by higher sales to EU countries (5.9%), namely to the Euro area (6.7%) and the non-Euro area (3.9%).

In contrast, sales to third countries dropped by 0.5%, weighed by lower sales to the US (-3.5%), Russia (-19.9%), and the UK (-6.6%).

Meanwhile, imports rose 2.1% to EUR 111.1 billion, faster than forecasts of 1.8% growth.

Purchases from the EU climbed by 3.6% and those from third countries grew by 0.5%, with notable rises from the US (3.0%) and Russia (14.4%).

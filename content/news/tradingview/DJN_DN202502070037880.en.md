Singapore's FTSE Straits Times Index rose 0.8% to close at 3861.42 as investors' mood stabilized. The overall risk environment was calmer than it was at the beginning of the week, IG's Yeap Jun Rong says in commentary. The temporary pause in U.S. tariff developments has offered some relief, the market strategist adds. Among the best performers on the benchmark index, Singapore Exchange climbed 10% and ST Engineering added 3.5%. CapitaLand Ascendas REIT rose 1.9% following its annual results. Meanwhile, Jardine Matheson Holdings fell 1.4% and Thai Beverage shed 1.0%. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

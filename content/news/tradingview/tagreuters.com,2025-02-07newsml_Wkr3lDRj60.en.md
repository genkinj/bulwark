Diagonal Bio AB

The subscription period in Diagonal Bio AB's ("Diagonal Bio" or the "Company") rights issue of units of initially approximately SEK 6.0 million ended on 6 February 2025 (the "Rights Issue"). The Rights Issue was subscribed to a total of approximately 122 percent, including subscription undertakings, meaning that no underwriting commitments have been utilized. In parallel with the Rights Issue, the Company has carried out the directed issue of units which was announced on 23 December 2024 and approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting 17 January 2025, of initially approximately SEK 1.7 million to Redén Trotting AB and Svea Bank AB (the "Directed Issue"). In total, through the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue, Diagonal Bio is thus provided proceeds of approximately SEK 7.7 million before deduction of issue related costs. Should all attached warrants of series TO 2 issued in the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue be exercised, the Company may receive additional proceeds of approximately SEK 3.4 million in June 2025.

NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, BELARUS, HONG KONG, JAPAN, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA, SINGAPORE, SOUTH AFRICA, SOUTH KOREA OR IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION IN WHICH THE RELEASE, DISTRIBUTION OR PUBLICATION OF THIS PRESS RELEASE WOULD BE UNLAWFUL, REQUIRE REGISTRATION OR ANY OTHER MEASURES.

“I am very glad to announce the outcome of this successful transaction – we now have the funds to move forward with the exciting plans we have, and provided that all warrants are exercised, Diagonal Bio will be financed until Q1 2026. In the time until then, it is our assessment that with completed pilot studies, studies that have been converted into sales agreements and expansion in our three main segments – horse, pig and fish – we will have established a solid platform for continued expansion. We will primarily focus on validating LAMPlify's commercial interest in the equine segment, by reaching the targets we have set for initiating new pilot projects and results from completed pilot projects, with the overall goal of achieving market acceptance by the end of 2025" - Karin Wehlin, CEO of Diagonal Bio AB (publ)

**Subscription, allocation and payment**

The Rights Issue was subscribed to a total of approximately SEK 7.3 million including subscription undertakings of approximately SEK 0.4 million, which corresponds to a subscription rate of approximately 122 percent. Diagonal Bio is thus, through the Rights Issue, provided with approximately SEK 6.0 million before issue related costs of approximately SEK 1.5 million (of which approximately SEK 0.45 million refers to underwriting fees, if all external underwriters desire to receive cash compensation).

A total of 26,116,901 units were subscribed for with the support of unit rights, including subscription undertakings. A total of 14,666,393 units were subscribed without the support of unit rights. Through the Rights Issue, 601,071,318 new shares and 267,142,808 warrants of series TO 2 will be issued. The subscribers who are allocated units without support of unit rights will receive settlement notes, which are planned to be sent out after a formal board decision on allocation. Allotted units without pre-emptive unit rights shall be paid in accordance with the instructions on the settlement note.

Through the Directed Issue, 166,599,972 new shares and 74,044,432 warrants of series TO 2 are issued.

**Compensation for underwriting commitments**

For the top-down underwriting commitments provided by external underwriters, the underwriters receive an underwriting compensation of 15 percent in cash or 17 percent in the form of units (on the same terms as in the Rights Issue). No compensation is paid for the top-down underwriting provided by CEO Karin Wehlin or the board members.

**Terms for warrants of series TO 2**

Warrants of series TO 2 are issued both through the Directed Issue and the Rights Issue. One (1) warrant of series TO 2 gives the holder the right to subscribe for one (1) new share in Diagonal Bio during the period that runs from and including 4 June 2025, to and including 18 June 2025. The exercise price for warrants series TO 2 has been set to SEK 0.01 per new share. The Company may receive a maximum of approximately SEK 3.4 million from the exercise of warrants of series TO 2, before deduction of issue related costs, which are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 0.4 million.

The warrants are intended to be admitted to trading on Nasdaq First North Growth Market after final registration of the Directed Issue and the Rights Issue with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The last day of trading in TO 2 is expected to be 16 June 2025.

**Number of shares, warrants and share capital**

When the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the total number of shares will have increased by 767,671,290 shares, from 400,714,213 shares to 1,168,385,503 shares. The Extraordinary General Meeting in Diagonal Bio resolved, on 17 January 2025, to reduce the share capital for allocation to non-restricted equity by an amount corresponding to the maximum initial share capital increase from the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue. The maximum initial share capital increase from the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue is SEK 7,659,877.37 meaning that, upon registration of the Rights Issue and the Directed Issue the share capital will also be reduced with the same amount, resulting in the share capital not increasing from SEK 3,998,354.20. Following the share capital reduction, the share's quota value will be approximately SEK 0.0034.

In the event of full exercise of all issued warrants of series TO2 for subscription of new shares in the Company, the number of shares will increase by an additional 341,187,240 shares to a total of 1,509,572,743 shares and the share capital will increase by additional SEK 5,132,547.33.

The shareholders who have not participated in the Rights Issue or the Directed Issue will be subject to a dilution effect corresponding to approximately 66 percent of the votes and capital in the Company. If all warrants of series TO 2 are exercised for subscription of new shares, they will result in a dilution of approximately 23 percent for those not participating in the warrant exercise.

**Trading in BTU**

Trading in BTU's (Paid Subscribed Unit) is currently ongoing on Nasdaq First North Growth Market under the short name DIABIO BTU and will cease after the Rights Issue has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The registration is expected to take place around 20 February 2025. Thereafter, after approximately one week, BTU will be converted into shares and warrants of series TO 2. The shares and warrants will then be admitted to trading on First North Growth Market as soon as possible after registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.

**Lock up**

The Board and management have, through a lock-up agreement, with Navia Corporate Finance AB as counterparty, undertaken, with customary exceptions, not to sell any of the existing shareholding or such shareholding that has been acquired through subscription in the Rights Issue, for a period lasting until 31 July 2025.

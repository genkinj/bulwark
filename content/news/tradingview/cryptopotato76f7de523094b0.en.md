Somewhat unexpectedly, all the drama started during the previous weekend, which is typically a calmer period for the financial markets. Well, except crypto, because it’s open 24/7.

President Trump’s implementation of new taxes on Canada, China, and Mexico broughtmass panicacross the charts. On Saturday evening and Sunday, BTC tumbled from $102,000 to under $100,000 and down to $97,000. It managed to catch its breath on Sunday afternoon, but the bears were back in control of the market on Monday morning.

In a matter of hours, BTC slumped hard and fell below $92,000 for the first time in about two weeks. Consequently, bitcoin had lost ten grand within 24 hours and roughly $15,000 since last Friday when it stood above $106,000.

After that multi-week low, though, the cryptocurrency bounced off and jumped above $100,000 and back to $102,000, thus completinganother ten-grand movewithin hours. Nevertheless, it failed to sustain within six-digit territory and headed south in the following days. It flirted with the $96,000 support line on several occasions but so far has managed to maintain above it.

Hours ago, BTC pumped by a few grand and touched $100,000 for the first time since Monday, following the US jobs data. However, it couldn’t keep the momentum going and is now back below it.

The weekly charts are quite painful for most altcoins. Ethereum is down by 17% and trades well below $2,800. XRP has plunged by 18% to under $2.5, while DOGE, ADA, LINK, AVAX, and SUI have plummeted by over 20%.

In fact, OM is the only larger-cap altcoin in the green. An 18% surge since last Friday has pushed its price to well above $6.Market Data

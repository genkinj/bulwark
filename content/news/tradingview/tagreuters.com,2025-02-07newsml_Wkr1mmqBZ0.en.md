Scandi Standard

Scandi Standard has been awarded an 'A' rating for climate actions by the global investor rating CDP. This rating is based on our 2024 reporting and recognizes Scandi Standard's commitment to environmental transparency and actions to mitigate climate change.

- We are proud to have been awarded an `A' from CDP, it is a testament to our hard work and dedication to sustainability across Scandi Standard. Sustainability is an integrated part of our day-to-day operations, and I am also very proud of all the hard work put in by the entire company over the last few years, says Ida Ljungkvist, Group Sustainability Director, Scandi Standard.

Over the past four years Scandi Standard has undertaken extensive measures, including mapping and calculating climate impact across the entire value chain and at product level, setting science-based targets (SBTs), and developing a Climate Transition Plan. We have also identified and implemented emission reduction initiatives within the organization and value chain, linked climate goals to compensation and financing, and ensured transparent reporting at the site level. Additionally, we have set a clear governance structure and accountability all the way up to the board.

- Scandi Standard will continue along the established path and implement the planned initiatives, as well as new ones, to reduce our actual climate impact in our own operations and value chain - together with suppliers and customers, says Ida Ljungkvist.

A total of 24,800+ companies were evaluated globally, and more information on who made the A-list will be disclosed later in 2025.

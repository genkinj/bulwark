On the face of it, BPER’s $4.5 bln all-share bid for Banca Popolare di Sondrio is just another tie-up in a domestic merger trail blazed by UniCredit and others. But while those deals remain live, they may not all happen. If so, bulking up now might allow BPER to play a role.

CONTEXT NEWS

Italy’s fourth-largest bank BPER on February 6 launched a 4.3 billion euro ($4.46 billion) all-share bid for Banca Popolare di Sondrio (BPSO).

BPER said it would issue 29 new shares for every 20 shares of BPSO tendered, implying a premium of 6.6% based on its closing levels on February 5.

BPER and BPSO have in common their main shareholder, insurer Unipol, which distributes its products through both banks.

BPER said it aimed to secure at least 35% of BPSO’s capital plus one share in order to exert control over the rival.

BPSO shares were trading at 9.75 euros on the morning of February 7, up 5.2%. BPER shares were trading at 6.4 euros, down 7%.

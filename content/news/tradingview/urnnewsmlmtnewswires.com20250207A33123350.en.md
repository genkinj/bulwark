Xtract One Technologies on Friday said its Xtract One Gateway has been selected to protect key hospital locations in Manitoba, including at the province's Health Sciences Centre and Crisis Response Centre locations operated by Shared Health.

Gateway unobtrusively scans individuals, pockets, bags and backpacks for potential mass casualty weapons while distinguishing harmless personal items like laptops, tablets and phones, streamlining access into and out of facilities without disrupting the flow of movement.

Shares of the company closed down $0.020 or 3.8%, to $0.51 on Thursday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Nutriband Inc. , a company engaged in the development of prescription transdermal pharmaceutical products, today announced that it received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on February 3, 2025 for patent application 18/369,241, "Abuse and Misuse Deterrent Transdermal Systems" which covers its Aversa™ abuse deterrent technology. The receipt of a Notice of Allowance means that the USPTO is expected to issue a U.S. patent for this application after administrative processes have been completed.

The expected issuance of this patent further expands Nutriband’s intellectual property protection in the United States for its portfolio of abuse deterrent transdermal products based on its proprietary Aversa™ abuse deterrent technology. This technology can be incorporated into transdermal patches to prevent the abuse, diversion, misuse, and accidental exposure of drugs with abuse potential. Nutriband’s lead product under development is Aversa™ Fentanyl, an abuse deterrent fentanyl transdermal system, with the potential to become the first and only abuse deterrent pain patch on the market.

Nutriband’s AVERSA™ abuse-deterrent technology can be utilized to incorporate aversive agents into transdermal patches to prevent the abuse, diversion, misuse, and accidental exposure of drugs with abuse potential including opioids and stimulants. The technology consists of a proprietary aversive agent coating that employs taste aversion to deter the oral abuse of and accidental exposure to transdermal opioid and stimulant patch products.

The AVERSA™ abuse deterrent technology is protected by a broad international intellectual property portfolio with patents issued in 46 countries including the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, Russia, China, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.

AVERSA Fentanyl has the potential to be the world’s first abuse-deterrent opioid patch designed to deter the abuse and misuse and reduce the risk of accidental exposure of transdermal fentanyl patches. AVERSA Fentanyl has the potential to reach peak annual US sales of $80 million to $200 million.1

Newcastle coal futures fell to $109 per tonne in February, the lowest in nearly four years, as data points to an increasingly oversupplied market.

China announced that its output is set to expand 1.5% to 4.82 billion tons in 2025 following a record-setting 2024, aiming to expand mining capacity to avoid availability risks from carbon emission limits and mine shutdowns for safety protocol breaches.

The development occurred as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, which rose by 12% in the two months ending October.

Also, Indonesian output rose to a record high 836 million tonnes in 2024, 18% above its target.

In the meantime, China threatened to impose tariffs on US coal next week should the US maintain its blanket restrictions on China.

However, the impact on thermal coal is minimal, as US imports made up 0.8% of China’s foreign thermal coal purchases in 2024.

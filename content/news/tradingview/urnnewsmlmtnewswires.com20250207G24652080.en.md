Stocks were lower on Friday, with the blue-chip DAX index down 0.53% at closing, after latest data showed a downbeat picture for the German industry.

Industrial production in Germany fell 2.4% month over month in December 2024, compared with the previous 1.3% increase and the consensus estimate of a 0.6% decline. For the entirety of 2024, German industrial output decreased 4.5% year over year.

At the same time, Germany's trade surplus rose to 20.7 billion euros from 19.2 billion euros in November 2024. According to provisional data from Destatis, monthly exports were up 2.9%, while imports grew 2.1%.

"While the catch-up in exports points to some frontloading ahead of looming tariffs, the renewed weakening of industrial production confirms the structural weakness," ING said. "Add to this looming tariffs on the EU and the expected modern version of 'beggar-thy-neighbor' policies by the new US administration, and the outlook for German industry remains anything but rosy. This is not just because of the potential impact on German exports, but more so the effect on German investments if companies were to move production to the US."

Across the pond, the US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, below the revised 307,000 increase a month ago and the market forecast of 170,000. The US unemployment rate was 4%, down from the previous and expected 4.1%.

In corporate news, Porsche AG was the index's worst-performing stock at 7.15% in the red after flagging an 800 million-euro financial impact in 2025 from its growth and profitability measures. Consequently, Porsche Automobil Holding SE raised its impairment loss forecast linked to its investment in Porsche AG to between 2.5 billion euros and 3.5 billion euros from the prior estimate of 1 billion euros to 2 billion euros. The stock was 2% lower at closing.

"We have argued before that a premium multiple requires premium execution and we see this as P911's last shot to prove they can turn around this business before losing more trust of long-term shareholders," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.

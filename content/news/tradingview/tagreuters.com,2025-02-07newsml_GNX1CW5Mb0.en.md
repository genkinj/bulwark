PHOENIX, Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Big Auto Injury Attorneys and The Popok Firm are proud to announce that they have formed a new partnership with the widely popular “Legal AF” podcast, a part of MeidasTouch Network, to champion justice.

Hosted by MeidasTouch Network founder and civil rights lawyer Ben Meiselas, national trial lawyer strategist Michael Popok and former Chief Assistant District Attorney of the Manhattan District Attorney's office Karen Friedman Agnifilo, “Legal AF” is a trusted source for in-depth discussions on the intersection of law and politics.

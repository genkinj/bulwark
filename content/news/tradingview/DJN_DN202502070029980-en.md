Chinese banks likely issued CNY4.3 trillion in new yuan loans in January, up from CNY990 billion in December as they front-loaded lending quotas at the start of the year, according to a poll of economists by WSJ. That amount would be below the CNY4.92 trillion issued in January last year, signaling weakness in credit demand. The upcoming loan data might have been affected by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday. Businesses suspended operations early this year as workers returned home. Meanwhile, M2--the broadest measure of money supply--likely rose 7.4% on year in January, up slightly from December's 7.3%. The People's Bank of China will likely release the data next week.

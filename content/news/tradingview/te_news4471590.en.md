The UK’s 10-year gilt yield climbed to 4.5%, mirroring gains in US Treasury yields as strong labor data gave the Federal Reserve more room to delay rate cuts.

In the UK, the Bank of England lowered rates by 25bps to 4.5% and halved its growth forecast to 0.75%.

Despite this, two BoE policymakers, including hawkish Catherine Mann, pushed for a deeper 50bps cut.

Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned against overanalyzing the shift, but markets remained uncertain.

Meanwhile, the BoE raised its inflation forecast to 3.7% from 2.8%, highlighting the challenge of cutting rates while inflation remains stubborn.

Having already cut rates three times since August, traders still expect about 60bps of further easing this year.

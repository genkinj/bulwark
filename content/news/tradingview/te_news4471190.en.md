Bulgaria’s consumer confidence indicator dropped to -19.5 in the first quarter of 2025 from -12.2 in the previous three-month period.

This marked the lowest reading since the fourth quarter of 2023, as consumers were more pessimistic regarding the financial situation for their households (-12.8 vs -4.2 in Q4) and the economic situation of Bulgaria for the next 12 months (-26.3 vs -17.9).

At the same time, households were more unlikely to make major purchases for durable goods in the upcoming twelve months (-20.6 vs -18.4) and assessments on saving propensity were more negative a year from now (-50.8 vs -49.6).

Meanwhile, concerns for the next twelve months were heightened about unemployment (18 vs 17.2) and inflation (25.7 vs 9.7).

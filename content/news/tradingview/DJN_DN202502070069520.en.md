Solid Canadian job growth in January gives the Bank of Canada some flexibility should President Trump refrain from hefty tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports in early March, says Desjardins Group economist Royce Mendes. Canada added a net 76,000 jobs, well above market expectations, with most of the hiring in the private sector. The unemployment rate fell again, to 6.6% in January after peaking at 6.9% in November. Absent hefty tariffs, Mendes says BOC might choose to keep its policy rate unchanged in March, noting BOC Gov. Tiff Macklem delivered "somewhat hawkish" remarks Thursday at a conference hosted by Bank for International Settlements. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

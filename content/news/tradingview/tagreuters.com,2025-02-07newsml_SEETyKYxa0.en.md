ZAGREB (Croatia), February 7 (SeeNews) - The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency said it has selected a project coordinated by Croatian electricity trader Electrip Mobility Service to be backed under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility (AFIF) of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), the EU funding programme supporting European transport infrastructure.

The recommended CEF funding for this project is 5.52 million euro ($5.7 million), the agency said in a press release on Thursday.

The project will deploy recharging infrastructure for Light-Duty Vehicles along the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) road network across Bulgaria, Croatia and Poland, including 53 multi-point charging stations with a minimum power output of 150 kW each.

It is one of 39 projects for which the EU is allocating nearly 422 million euro to deploy alternative fuel supply infrastructure along the TEN-T, contributing to decarbonisation.

Electrip Mobility Service is a fully-owned subsidiary of Dutch Electrip Global, according to data from the Croatian court registry.

The Singapore dollar is steady against its U.S. counterpart during the Asian session ahead of the U.S. January employment report due out later today. Consensus expects creation of 175,000 new jobs and average hourly earnings to come in steady at 0.3% on month, two members of the OCBC FX and Rates Strategy team say in a note. "A softer than expected print should weigh on USD," the members say. Recent U.S. economic data have mostly been weaker than expected, which reinforces OCBC's view that the Fed remains on track to cut rates, they add. USD/SGD is little changed at 1.3515.

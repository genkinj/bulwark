**About Orlando's Black History Month Celebration:**

The City of Orlando is pleased to celebrate the positive contributions of our African American residents by dedicating the month of February to the rich and diverse Black culture and heritage. Black history is an integral part of American history because Black people have played an essential role in building and shaping this great country.

Orlando's prestigious Black History Month celebration will feature an opening reception of an art exhibition at City Hall's Terrace Gallery and our signature community celebration event, which will highlight this year's theme, "African Americans and the Arts" allowing our Orlando community to celebrate the rich contributions of African American residents to our nation's cultural landscape throughout its history in the visual arts, performing arts, literature, film, music and much more.

As a welcoming and inclusive city, Orlando is committed to continuing to celebrate our differences and dedicating this month to the rich and diverse Black culture and heritage.

**About Orlando Credit Union:**

Orlando Credit Union was founded on the universal credit union creed of "not for profit, not for charity, but for service." It is why more than 26,000 members turn to us still, more than 88 years after founding.

We believe in offering a better banking alternative. Because Orlando Credit Union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative, our earnings go back into the credit union to be able to offer competitive rates on savings and loan products, and lower fees than other financial service providers. We strive to empower our members to achieve big dreams.

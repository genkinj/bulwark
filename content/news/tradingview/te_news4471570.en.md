Canada’s 10-year government bond yield rose to 3.07%, rebounding from a four-month low of 2.95% on February 5th, as strong labor market data reduced the urgency for rate cuts by the BoC. The unemployment rate fell to 6.6% in January from 6.7% in December, defying expectations of a rise to 6.8% and easing concerns about labor market weakness flagged by the BoC. Similarly, U.S. Treasury yields climbed as solid job data and rising wages reinforced the Fed’s flexibility to delay rate cuts.

Additionally, safe-haven demand eased after Prime Minister Trudeau confirmed a 30-day pause on U.S. tariffs against Canadian goods, alleviating immediate trade concerns that had fueled risk aversion.

However, the BoC’s dovish stance, marked by ending quantitative tightening, capped yield gains.

Its recent 25 bp rate cut to 3% included plans to resume asset purchases in March, starting with the repo program, followed by bill auctions and a return to secondary market bond purchases by 2026.

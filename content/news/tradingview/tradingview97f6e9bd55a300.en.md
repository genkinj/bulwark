Fortive Corporation, a provider of essential technologies for connected workflow solutions, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. The company reported robust margin expansion and record cash flow, driven by strong execution and innovation through the Fortive Business System (FBS).

**Financial Highlights**

For the fourth quarter of 2024, Fortive reported:

* GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60, with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.17, marking a 19% increase year-over-year.
* Operating cash flow of $502 million and free cash flow of $465 million, up 13% year-over-year.
* Revenues increased by 2% year-over-year to $1.62 billion, including 2% core revenue growth.

For the full year 2024, the company reported:

* Net earnings of $833 million, with adjusted net earnings of $1.37 billion.
* GAAP diluted EPS of $2.36, with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.89.
* Revenues increased by 3% year-over-year to $6.23 billion, including 1% core revenue growth.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

Fortive's Intelligent Operating Solutions (IOS) and Advanced Healthcare Solutions (AHS) segments showed continued growth, driven by steady demand for safety and productivity solutions and increased contributions from FBS-driven product innovations. The Precision Technologies (PT) segment experienced double-digit order growth for the second consecutive quarter, indicating a gradual recovery expected to continue through 2025.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

Fortive is progressing well with the separation of its Precision Technologies segment, which is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2025. The new independent publicly traded company will be named Ralliant. This separation aims to create two focused entities: one retaining the Fortive name, focusing on Intelligent Operating Solutions and Advanced Healthcare Solutions, and the other, Ralliant, focusing on precision instruments and highly engineered products.

**Management's Perspective**

James A. Lico, President and CEO, commented, "Our fourth quarter results once again demonstrated strong execution despite the mixed macro environment, leading to better-than-expected core growth, earnings, and free cash flow. As we look ahead, Fortive is poised for improving core sales growth and continued strong operating performance again in 2025."

**Future Outlook**

For the first quarter of 2025, Fortive anticipates revenue of $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion, with diluted net earnings per share of $0.39 to $0.42 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.86. For the full year 2025, the company expects revenue of approximately $6.23 billion to $6.35 billion, with GAAP diluted EPS of $2.38 to $2.50 and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.00 to $4.12.

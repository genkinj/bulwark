Iron ore prices for cargoes with 62% iron content climbed above $106 per ton in early February, reaching a two-month high as steel production in China resumed following the Lunar New Year holidays, boosting short-term demand for the metal.

On the supply side, weather disruptions in Australia added a risk premium to iron ore prices.

Specifically, tropical cyclones in Western Australia forced Rio Tinto to clear iron ore ships from ports, compounding shipping bottlenecks that had already been affected by disruptions in rail operations.

Iron ore prices also benefited from a sharp pullback in the US dollar, as concerns over a global trade war eased following relatively restrained tariff measures from both the US and China.

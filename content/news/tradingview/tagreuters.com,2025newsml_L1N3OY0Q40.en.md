WALL STREET EASES EARLY WITH AMAZON

The three major U.S. stock indexes are modestly lower in early trading on Friday, led by declines in the Nasdaq as Amazon.com shares are down more than 4% after its quarterly results and signs of weakness in the retailer's cloud computing unit.

Investors also are digesting the latest U.S. jobs report. It showed the U.S. economy added 143,000 jobs in January, compared with a rise of 170,000 expected by economists.

The Amazon news added to investor concerns that Big Tech's massive artificial intelligence investments were taking longer to deliver returns.

Amazon late Thursday also gave lower-than-expected forecasts for first-quarter revenue and profit.

Shares of Microsoft are down 0.5% in early trading.

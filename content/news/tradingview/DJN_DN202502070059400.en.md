Porsche's guidance implies 2025 EBIT will be 26% below consensus estimates, with the warning mostly related to slow electric-vehicle demand and restructuring costs, Morgan Stanley writes. The company's revenue guidance of 39 billion to 40 billion euros is 1% below consensus. Return on sales guidance of 10%-12% compares to consensus at 14.7%, while the forecast automotive net cash flow margin of 7%-9% compares with consensus at 10%. The company plans extensive measures to improve profitability, including an expanded product pipeline, expansion of personalized products and corporate organization adjustment. The market is expecting a new combustion-engine Macan model in Europe in 2026, and if Porsche decides to launch it, this could support capacity utilization and margins, the bank adds. Shares trade 5.4% lower at 56.62 euros. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)

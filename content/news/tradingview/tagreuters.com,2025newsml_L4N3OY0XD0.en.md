\*\* Shares of gene sequencing equipment maker Illumina fall 4.7% to $117 premarket

\*\* Co, late on Thursday, forecast 2025 revenue largely below Wall Street estimates

\*\* Co expects 2025 revenue between $4.28 bln and $4.40 bln, below analysts' average estimate of $4.39 bln at midpoint, according to data compiled by LSEG

\*\* China, which accounts for about 7% of Illumina's sales, placed co on its "unreliable entity" list earlier this week

\*\* Illumina said its forecast does not reflect any impact from announcement from China

\*\* "The lack of adjusting could mean there's hope they could be removed from the 'unreliable entity list' or that they can't yet quantify it" - Piper Sandler analysts

\*\* Up to last close, stock down ~12% in the past 12 months

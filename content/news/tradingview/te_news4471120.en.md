The CAC 40 traded flat around 8,011 on Friday, following an eight-month high reached in the previous session, as traders digested a fresh wave of corporate earnings and awaited the US jobs report for insights into the Federal Reserve’s next policy moves.

In France, the trade deficit narrowed to €3.9 billion in December 2024 from a revised €6.3 billion in November and better than the expected €5.3 billion shortfall, marking the smallest trade gap since November 2020.

On the corporate front, L'Oréal saw a 2.3% drop after posting weaker-than-expected Q4 sales, hurt by sluggish demand in China.

Pernod Ricard followed suit, falling 1.6% after lowering its expectations for the fiscal year and beyond, citing worsening trends in China and global trade tariff uncertainties.

On a positive note, Vinci gained 3.2% after reporting stronger-than-expected full-year results, with Q4 revenues and H2 EBIT surpassing expectations.

Over the week, the CAC 40 is set for its fifth consecutive weekly gain.

Bill.com reported messy fiscal Q2 financial results amid a Q3 revenue guidance miss, but these pressures will likely ease in H2, Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients Friday.

Foreign exchange headwinds and seasonality led to a quarter-over-quarter decline in the company's take rate and year-over-year payment volume growth fell short of investor expectations, the analysts said. But payment adoption improved, and product and go-to-market changes are expected to drive take rate expansion in the coming quarters, the analysts added.

Despite a large online advertiser shifting payment methods, which hurt Spend & Expense growth, Morgan Stanley said the main bull case for Bill.com remains intact, supported by the temporary nature of headwinds and improving fundamentals.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for the stock and lowered its price target to $100 from $105, citing a longer timeline for investors to regain confidence in the company's take rate outlook.

Shares of the company were down nearly 33% in recent Friday premarket activity.

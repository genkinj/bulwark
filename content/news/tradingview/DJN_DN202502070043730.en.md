Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 1.25% at $9,405 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum 0.5% higher at $2,638 a ton. Base metals have gained on week after President Trump's tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for a month on Monday, easing initial fears of a supply shock and hit to demand. The national security angle of the tariff debates hasn't received much market attention yet, but Trump is planning to apply tariffs on strategic goods, including steel, aluminum and eventually copper, Citi analysts say in a note. Currently, copper on the U.S. commodities exchange Comex trades at a 6% premium over copper on the LME, which should move up to at least 10% and possibly more, Citi says. "We go long December Comex copper versus LME," Citi writes. (joseph.hoppe@wsj.com)

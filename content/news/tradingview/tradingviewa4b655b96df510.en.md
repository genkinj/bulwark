Newell Brands, a leading global consumer goods company, has released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024. The company, known for its portfolio of well-known brands such as Rubbermaid, Sharpie, and Coleman, has reported significant improvements in its operating and gross margins, despite a decline in net sales.

However, the company achieved a reported gross margin of 34.2%, up from 29.9% in the prior year period. The normalized gross margin increased to 34.6% from 31.1%.

The reported operating margin improved to 0.5% from negative 0.5% in the prior year period, while the normalized operating margin increased to 7.1% from 6.4%. The company reported a net loss of $54 million, an improvement from the $86 million loss in the prior year period. Normalized net income was $69 million, down slightly from $73 million in the prior year period. Reported diluted loss per share was $0.13, compared to $0.21 in the prior year period, while normalized diluted EPS was $0.16, compared to $0.18.

**Business and Operational Highlights**

The Home & Commercial Solutions segment reported net sales of $1.2 billion, with a core sales decline of 4.6%. The Outdoor & Recreation segment saw net sales of $152 million, with a core sales decline of 3.8%.

For the full year 2024, net sales were $7.6 billion, a decline of 6.8% compared to the prior year. The reported gross margin for the full year was 33.6%, up from 28.9% in the prior year. The normalized gross margin was 34.1%, compared to 29.5% in the prior year.

**Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments**

In January 2024, Newell Brands announced an organizational realignment aimed at strengthening its front-end commercial capabilities. The company realized annualized pretax savings of $75 million from this realignment, net of reinvestment, and incurred restructuring and related charges of $52 million.

During the fourth quarter, the company successfully refinanced $1.25 billion of debt at attractive rates, which was six times oversubscribed. This refinancing is part of Newell Brands' ongoing efforts to de-lever its balance sheet and improve its financial position.

**Management's Perspective**

Chris Peterson, Newell Brands President and CEO, highlighted the company's strong performance in 2024, driven by disciplined implementation of its new corporate strategy and operating model. He emphasized the significant improvements in gross and operating margins, as well as the company's focus on returning to sustainable topline growth.

Mark Erceg, Chief Financial Officer, noted the successful debt refinancing and the strong support received for the offering. He also pointed out the rapid and pronounced gross margin expansion achieved during a period of top line compression and inventory drawdown.

**Future Outlook**

Newell Brands has provided its preliminary outlook for the first quarter and full year 2025. The company expects net sales to decline in the range of 4% to 2% for the full year, with core sales ranging from a 2% decline to a 1% increase. The normalized EPS is projected to be between $0.70 and $0.76. The company also anticipates operating cash flow for the full year 2025 to be between $450 million and $500 million.

The dollar index edged up to 107.8 on Friday as traders assessed the latest jobs report, which continued to highlight a resilient labor market.

While payroll growth came in well below expectations, sharp upward revisions to the previous two months offset the miss.

Additionally, the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4%, and wage growth accelerated to 0.5%, surpassing forecasts.

The data reinforced the Federal Reserve’s stance on keeping interest rates steady for now, prompting traders to scale back expectations for rate cuts.

Markets are now pricing in fewer than two cuts this year.

Looking ahead, next week's CPI and PPI reports will provide further insight into inflation trends.

Despite Friday’s modest rebound, the dollar is on track to end the week lower following a sharp reversal driven by easing concerns over a global trade war.

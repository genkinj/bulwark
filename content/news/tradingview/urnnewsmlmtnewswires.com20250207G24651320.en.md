The Los Angeles wildfires are unlikely to alter the ratings of Asia-Pacific insurers and reinsurers given minimal exposure, Fitch Ratings said in a Thursday release.

The rating agency expects robust reinsurance programs to limit any potential impact, but the rising frequency of such events will likely increase costs globally.

Rising reinsurance expenses could have a long-term impact on Asia-Pacific insurers' capital and earnings, Fitch said.

Despite significant insured losses from the wildfires, Fitch expects Asia-Pacific insurers, especially Japanese and South Korean ones, to have manageable losses due to strong capital positions and diversified risk profiles.

However, the wildfires underscore wider challenges from heightened global catastrophes and climate change, Fitch said.

The event could indirectly affect treaty reinsurance capacity in the Asia-Pacific region, while the rising frequency of secondary perils is driving a shift in the risk solutions market, Fitch said.

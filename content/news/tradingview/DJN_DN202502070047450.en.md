Porsche AG reported a weak outlook, with the mid-point of its 2025 guidance implying consensus earnings-per-share downgrades of around 25%, UBS's Patrick Hummel writes. Revenues are guided at 39 billion-40 billion euros, which is in line with consensus. However, the operating margin corridor is expected at 10%-12% versus consensus of 14.4%. Meanwhile, the automotive net cash flow margin guidance of 7%-9% compares to an 8.8% consensus. UBS says that the recently disclosed executive changes and development of new combustion engine cars are opportunities to get the business back on track. However, this will take time and investments will remain high. "A turnaround of the negative earnings trend is not a matter of just a couple of quarters." Shares trade 5.3% lower at 56.68 euros.

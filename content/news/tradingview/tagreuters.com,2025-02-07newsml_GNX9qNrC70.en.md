"Our fourth quarter and full-year results capped another remarkable year for Kimco, as we reached the high end of our 2024 outlook, driven by the successful integration of the RPT acquisition and strong leasing results that led to significant growth in net operating income and FFO," said Kimco CEO Conor Flynn. "We remain well-positioned to sustain our strong operating performance with our portfolio of high-quality, grocery-anchored centers that provide essential goods and services in core markets with high barriers to entry and limited new supply. Coupled with our disciplined capital allocation and motivated team, we will continue to drive value creation for our shareholders."

**Financial Results**

**Fourth Quarter 2024**

Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $154.8 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to $133.4 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. This 4.5% increase per diluted share is primarily attributable to:

* The acquisition of RPT Realty (“RPT”), which was the main driver of growth in consolidated revenues from rental properties, net, of $73.2 million, partially offset by higher real estate taxes of $8.6 million, operating and maintenance expenses of $14.6 million, as well as increased depreciation and amortization expense of $31.8 million.
* $46.8 million in increased benefit for income taxes, net, due to a reduction in the tax provision related to the sale of Albertsons Companies Inc. shares.

Additional notable items impacting the year-over-year change include:

* $15.9 million increased interest expense in 2024 due to higher levels of outstanding debt compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 attributable to the RPT acquisition, which closed in the first quarter of 2024, and the issuance of $500 million of 4.850% senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2024.
* $22.3 million lower gain on sales of properties due to lower disposition activity during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

FFO was $286.9 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to $239.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, representing a per share increase of 7.7%. The company excludes from FFO all realized or unrealized marketable securities/derivatives gains, losses and applicable taxes, as well as gains and losses from the sales of properties, depreciation and amortization related to real estate, profit participations from other investments, and other items considered incidental to the company’s business.

**Full Year 2024**

Net income was $375.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to $629.3 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the full year 2023. The year-over-year change was primarily due to a $194.1 million special cash dividend received from ACI in 2023. In addition, the aforementioned acquisition of RPT was the main driver of the year-over-year increases in consolidated revenues from rental properties, net, real estate taxes, operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation and amortization, and interest expense.

FFO was $1.1 billion, or $1.65 per diluted share, compared to $970.0 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, for the full year 2023, representing 5.1% year-over-year growth.

**Operating Results**

* Signed 429 leases totaling 2.4 million square feet during the fourth quarter, generating blended pro-rata cash rent spreads on comparable spaces of 11.4%, with new leases up 35.4% and renewals and options growing 6.6%.
* Pro-rata leased occupancy ended the quarter at 96.3%, an increase of 10 basis points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially.
* Pro-rata anchor and small shop occupancy ended the quarter at 98.2% and 91.7%, respectively.
* Generated 4.5% growth in Same Property NOI in the fourth quarter over the same period a year ago, primarily driven by a 3.8% increase in minimum rents. For the full year, Same Property NOI grew 3.5% with minimum rents growing 3.3% driven by $33.8 million of rent that commenced during 2024.
* Pro-rata economic occupancy ended the quarter at 93.6%, a 90-basis-point year-over-year increase. The spread between the company’s leased versus economic occupancy was 270 basis points at year end, representing approximately $56 million in anticipated future annual base rent.

**Transactional Activities**

During the fourth quarter, the company:

* Purchased Waterford Lakes Town Center, a 976,000-square-foot signature asset spanning 79 acres in Orlando, Florida, for $322 million including the assumption of a $164.6 million mortgage.
* Provided mezzanine financing of $12.3 million for two grocery anchored shopping centers.
* Received a $4.9 million mezzanine loan repayment and, sold two land parcels for a total of $0.9 million.

Subsequent to quarter end and as previously announced, the company acquired The Markets at Town Center, a 254,000-square-foot center in Jacksonville, Florida, anchored by Sprouts Farmers Market for $108 million. This transaction marks the first property Kimco has acquired through its Structured Investment Program. The company previously provided $15 million in mezzanine financing that was repaid at closing.

**Capital Market Activities** 

During the fourth quarter, the company:

* Raised $136.3 million of net proceeds from the sale of 5.4 million shares of common stock through the company’s ATM equity offering program at an average price of $25.07 per share.
* Completed a cash tender for 409,772 depositary shares, with each depositary share representing 1/1,000 of a share, of the company’s 7.25% Class N Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock for a total of $26.7 million. The company incurred a charge of $3.3 million in conjunction with the tender offer.
* Redeemed various partnership units in separate transactions totaling $37.0 million.
* Ended the year with approximately $2.7 billion of immediate liquidity, including full availability on the $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $689.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
* In January of 2025, Moody’s affirmed the company’s Baa1 senior unsecured rating and changed its outlook to positive.

**Dividend Declarations**

* Kimco’s board of directors declared its quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share (equivalent to $1.00 per annum), payable on March 21, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 7, 2025.
* The board of directors also declared quarterly dividends with respect to each of the company’s Class L, Class M, and Class N series of preferred shares. These dividends on the preferred shares will be paid on April 15, 2025, to shareholders of record on April 1, 2025.

FFO available to the company’s common shareholders would be increased by $2,400 and $763 for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. FFO available to the company's common shareholders would be increased by $9,801 and $2,395 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effect of other certain convertible securities would have an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of FFO available to the company’s common shareholders per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted FFO per share calculations. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| (1 | ) | The company considers Same Property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate. Same Property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the company's properties. The company’s method of calculating Same Property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

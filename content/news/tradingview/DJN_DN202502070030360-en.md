Comex gold futures' upward movement is taking a minor pause, based on the daily chart, RHB Retail Research's Joseph Chai says in commentary. Although the relative strength index is sloping downward, which indicates slowing bullish momentum, the commodity remains above the 20- and 50-day simple moving averages, the analyst notes. Also, the precious metal posted a bearish candlestick with a long-legged shadow on Thursday, signaling that gold bulls still have the technical advantage, Chai says. During this consolidation phase, however, the commodity could pull back to test the $2,800/oz support level, he adds. Spot gold is 0.3% higher at $2,864.17/oz. (ronnie.harui@wsj.com)

1048 GMT - Indian shares edged lower, weighed by bank and technology stocks. Investors digested the market impacts of India's central bank kicking off its easing cycle, cutting its policy rate for the first time in nearly five years on Friday. State Bank of India dropped 1.4% and ICICI Bank declined 1.2%. Tata Consultancy Services was off by 1.3% and Infosys shed 0.7%. Tata Steel was the best performer on the benchmark index in this session, gaining 4.3%. India's benchmark Sensex Index ended 0.25% lower at 77860.19. (sherry.qin@wsj.com)

1036 GMT - U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are steady on caution ahead of U.S. jobs data at 1330 GMT which could offer hints on the interest-rate outlook. The Fed recently confirmed it was in no hurry to cut interest rates further, even as it left the door open to further reductions. Robust jobs figures would encourage the idea that there is little or possibly no scope for further rate cuts. Conversely, weak data could increase prospects of rate cuts, potentially weighing down on Treasury yields and the dollar, says DHF Capital S.A.'s Bas Kooijman in a note. The market continues to price two 25 basis point Fed rate cuts this year. Ten-year Treasury yields trade steady at 4.438%. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

1002 GMT - Demand in the sterling corporate bonds market is falling as investors prefer to invest instead in U.K. government bonds where there are tax benefits, Barclays analysts say in a note. "The tax advantages of low-cash-price gilts makes them hard to beat as an investment for households paying the top rate of income tax," the analysts say. The tax benefits are diverting retail investments into the gilt market and away from corporate bonds where there are no such benefits, Barclays says. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)

0933 GMT - Supply of sterling-denominated corporate bonds has declined considerably in recent years as U.K. companies increasingly issue bonds in the dollar market, Barclays analysts say in a note. "A key drive of this has been the steady shift by U.K. corporates into the dollar investment-grade market, reducing their borrowing in the sterling investment-grade [market] over the last 10 years," Barclays says. Other regions have also reduced issuance in sterling, worsening the decline, they say. "Sterling issuance has been disappointing for several quarters, with 2024 gross supply ending the year at 52.2 billion pounds ($64.9 billion), far short of the 70 billion pounds we forecast at the beginning of the year," Barclays says.

0931 GMT - The Polish zloty, Hungarian forint and Czech koruna rally on the prospect of a deal to end the war in Ukraine after the U.S. Trump administration mentioned progress on this, ING's Frantisek Taborsky says in a note. "The simultaneous rally in FX and rates suggests that positive sentiment on this [Ukraine] is likely driving the move." The zloty is particularly strong after Polish central bank Governor Adam Glapinski said Thursday there is no indication for interest rate cuts in 2025. The Polish zloty rises to its highest since April 2018 at 4.1860 per euro; the Hungarian forint hits a three-month high of 404.0331 per euro; and the Czech koruna rises to a six-week high of 25.0150 per euro, according to FactSet.

0908 GMT - A weaker-than-expected inflation print from China could exacerbate pressure on the yuan while supporting demand for government bonds, potentially lowering yields further, says Hassan Fawaz, chairman of broker GivTrade. Expectations are for the inflation report, due Sunday, to show that the rate held at 0.1% on year, he says. Trade tensions between China and the U.S. could further pressure investor sentiment, weighing on the yuan, he adds. Tariffs imposed by Trump have raised concerns about economic growth, which could keep the outlook for the yuan bearish in the near term and maintain downward pressure on yields.

0852 GMT - Yields on U.K. government bonds rise due to concerns about higher inflation keeping interest rates elevated. The Bank of England on Thursday cut interest rates but raised its inflation forecast for the third quarter to 3.7% from 2.8% in its November forecast. "The most striking announcement from the Bank of England [on Thursday] is not the cut in interest rates, but the prospect of inflation rising to 3.7% this year while its forecasts show the economy continuing to flirt with recession," AJ Bell's Laith Khalaf says in a note. The 10-year gilt yield rises 1 basis point to 4.472%, while eurozone bond yields are mostly slightly lower, Tradeweb data show. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)

0847 GMT - The euro could rise if the European Central Bank revises its estimate of the neutral rate higher, ING's Francesco Pesole says in a note. The neutral rate is a theoretical rate that neither stimulates nor slows economic growth, which the ECB will announce at 1200 GMT. ECB member Olli Rehn said Thursday that "we should not constrain our freedom of action because of a theoretical concept." Based on these comments and the fact that neutral rate projections embed much higher inflation than previously, the rate should be revised higher, Pesole says. When adding in a risk that U.S. jobs data at 1330 GMT could be weaker than expected, the euro could rise back to Wednesday's $1.0443 high. The euro rises 0.1% to $1.0400.(renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0844 GMT - According to the Halifax House Price Index, key indicators in the housing market look fairly positive despite waning consumer confidence and geopolitical uncertainties, RBC Capital Markets' Anthony Codling says in a note. January's average U.K. house price rose 0.7% to 295,270 pounds following December's 0.2% fall. This points to a resumption in house price momentum, which saw eight consecutive months of growth through November, Codling says. Current house prices are unlikely to change buyers' minds as the market's overall mood is one of stability rather than significant near-term rises or falls, he says. "There remains uncertainty around the broader macroeconomic outlook and mortgage rate path, but demand for homes continues to outstrip supply and house prices are rising despite stretched affordability."

0843 GMT - India's central bank got its easing cycle off to a neutral start, contrary to Barclays economists' expectations that it would shift to an accommodative policy stance. Still, they continue to predict another cut in April, noting that February's decision was unanimous and comes alongside expectations for low growth in the near term and closer-to-target inflation. The RBI's focus seems to have shifted to supporting growth, emphasizing that continued disinflation and slower growth offers space for less restrictive policy. That contrasts with its December statement highlighting inflation risks and saying that the foundations for growth come from price stability, Barclays says. It continues to see the policy repo rate falling to 5.5% by March 2026 from 6.25% now. (fabiana.negrinochoa@wsj.com)

0759 GMT - The dollar trades steady in early European trade but could fall slightly if U.S. January nonfarm payrolls data at 1330 GMT are weaker, Swissquote Bank analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya says in a note. The data could show growth in jobs and wages slowed while the unemployment rate held steady, she says. Annual revisions could also be adjusted downwards. In that case, "the week will end with the narrative that the U.S. jobs market is healthily slowing." That would allow the Federal Reserve to continue cutting interest rates slowly. Any dollar depreciation will remain limited against European currencies due to expectations for more rate cuts compared with the U.S. and safe-haven demand. The DXY dollar index is steady at 107.728.

0758 GMT - Eurozone government bond yields are little changed as markets await the European Central Bank's new estimate of neutral rate for potential clues on how far interest rates could fall. The neutral rate is a theoretical interest rate level which neither tightens nor stimulates the economy. "The announcement comes as the discussion on where the ECB rate should land intensifies after five cuts in the deposit rate to 2.75%," SEB Research's Erik Meyersson says in a note. With inflation expected at 2% this year, the ECB's executive board agrees that more cuts are likely, but exactly how many is difficult to say, the chief strategist says. The 10-year Bund yield rises 1 basis point to 2.376%, according to Tradeweb. (emese.bartha@wsj.com)

Singapore Exchange likely faces softer trading volumes in 2H FY 2025 as macro tailwinds in the prior half, including U.S. elections and China stimulus, taper off, CGS International analyst Andrea Choong says in a note. Choong reckons investors have "raced ahead" to price in potential pickup in trading volumes despite scant details on potential initiatives to revitalize the Singapore stock market. "At this stage, we think that expectations of impactful measures are running high, and unconvincing initiatives may result in some unwinding of SGX's recent re-rating." Choong maintains a hold rating on the stock, and raises the target to S$13.20 from S$12.50 after taking into account elevated clearing fees, cost control and higher treasury income. Shares rise 6.45% to S$13.53. (hoishan.chan@wsj.com)

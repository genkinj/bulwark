The euro looks vulnerable given President Trump's threats to implement tariffs on the EU, UBS Global Wealth Management analysts say in a note. Trump's focus regarding tariffs is likely to turn to Europe next, they say. "Our base case is for select tariffs on EU autos and pharmaceuticals, drawing reciprocal retaliation." A negative reaction is "all but inevitable" for the euro. Beyond tariff considerations, the U.S. macroeconomic backdrop should prove supportive of the dollar. On monetary policy, the Federal Reserve should keep interest rates on hold while the European Central Bank continues to cut rates. UBS recommends selling the euro with a target of $1.0000 and stop loss of $1.0575. It currently trades at $1.0389. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

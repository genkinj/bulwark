CVC Capital Partners has sounded out Italian government officials over its plans to buy Vivendi's stake in Telecom Italia (TIM) , two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

CVC needs to win Rome's backing because the government has the powers to vet any investment handing the buyer a stake in TIM higher than 3%.

The sources said CVC representatives held talks with the Italian government officials over a potential deal, which would see CVC becoming TIM's largest investor with a 24% stake, followed by Italian state lender CDP.

The private equity fund has not secured Rome's support at this stage but discussions are ongoing, according to the people, who cautioned a deal may not materialise.

CVC and the Italian prime minister's office declined to comment. Italy's Treasury was not immediately available to comment. Vivendi did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

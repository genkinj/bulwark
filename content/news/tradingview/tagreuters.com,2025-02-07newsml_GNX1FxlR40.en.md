Construction of Arq’s GAC production facility remains on schedule, with initial production expected in Q1 2025

Customer negotiations for GAC contracts progressing well

GAC production ramp-up set to begin in H1 2025, with full run-rate of 25 million pounds targeted for H2 2025

GREENWOOD VILLAGE, Colo., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Arq, Inc. (the "Company" or "Arq"), a producer of activated carbon and other environmentally efficient carbon products for use in purification and sustainable materials, today provided an update on the continued execution of its Granular Activated Carbon ("GAC") project.

**GAC Production and Ramp-Up Timeline**

Arq confirmed that initial production of its proprietary GAC at the Red River facility ("Red River") remains on track to commence in Q1 2025, in line with most recent guidance. Following first production, the Company expects a ramp-up period to reach full production capacity of 25 million pounds annual run-rate of GAC in H2 2025. Once full run-rate capacity is achieved, the Company will have greater visibility on potential additional capacity enhancements.

**GAC Customer Engagement & Contract Update** 

Arq continues to make meaningful progress in commercial discussions for GAC and continues to engage with a range of customers and testing opportunities. As noted on its Q3 2024 earnings call, in addition to PFAS-related customers, discussions with biogas and other industrial customers are advancing positively, with early pricing indications indicating a strong commercial opportunity. Given the need for in-situ pilot testing as a condition to securing long-term contracts from these customers, Arq has elected to strategically hold back additional contract commitments to diversify end-use markets and focus on profitability over volumes. The Company is planning to match its contracting and sales with the production ramp-up timeline in H2 2025.

**Capital Expenditures & Cost Management**

Arq reported capital expenditures related to its GAC expansion at Red River in Q4 2024 were slightly above expectations, bringing full-year 2024 capex for this project to approximately $80 million. The Company attributes this recent increase to several factors, including the need for additional external professional services, increased small-bore piping needs, and a commitment to maintaining previously communicated timelines. Given knowledge and experience gained from the first phase of construction, the Company does not anticipate similar cost overruns for a second phase of GAC development at the site. Arq continues to evaluate opportunities for additional cost optimization and efficiency gains as the Company scales production.

**Commencement of Legal Proceedings**

The Company announced today that it had commenced legal proceedings against its design firm for the GAC expansion project at Red River. The Company believes that the design firm was negligent and breached its contract with the Company and as a direct result of this negligence and breach of contract, the Company suffered a material increase in costs and time delays associated with the project versus original forecasts. The Company is seeking damages related to the increased costs and delays it believes resulted from such negligence and contractual breaches. Because of prior actions by the Company to bring certain professional services in-house and to other parties, including those previously disclosed, the Company believes there will be no impact on product performance and as noted above, GAC production is expected to commence in Q1 2025.

**Q4 & FY 2024 Earnings Conference Call**

Arq will release its Q4 and full-year 2024 financial results on March 5, 2025. The Company will provide separately additional details related to its earnings conference call, as well as its participation in upcoming investor conferences in the near term.

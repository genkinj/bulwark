By Anthony O. Goriainoff

Belluscura said it will raise around 4 million pounds ($5 million) via a discounted placing with proceeds going toward product-inventory purchases, general working capital purposes, and to bolster its balance sheet.

The London-listed developer of medical devices said Friday that it will place 199.15 million ordinary shares at 2 pence a share, representing a 69% discount to Thursday's closing price of 6.50 pence.

Belluscura said certain company directors will participate in the placing.

The company said separately that it aims to raise a further 500,000 pounds via a conditional retail offer. Under the retail offer, the company will place up to 25 million new ordinary shares at the placing price.

Belluscura said the retail offer wasn't part of the placing and that its completion depended on the completion of the placing.

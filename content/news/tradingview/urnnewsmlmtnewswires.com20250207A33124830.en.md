Financial stocks were edging higher pre-bell Friday with the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) recently advancing by 0.1%.

The Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (FAS) was 0.2% lower and its bearish counterpart Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (FAZ) was up 0.2%.

Affirm Holdings' shares were up more than 13% pre-bell Friday after the payment network company unexpectedly swung to a profit in fiscal Q2 while guiding full-year sales above market consensus.

Pernod Ricard is working with Rothschild & Co for the potential sale of its G.H. Mumm champagne brand, Reuters reported Friday, citing five sources familiar with the matter.

Mumm could be sold for at least three times its annual sales of 200 million euros. The French wine and spirits company has been selective when it comes to the buyers, and there is no assurance a deal will be made, the sources added.

Pernod Ricard did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MT Newswires.

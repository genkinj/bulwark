Accenture will no longer pursue global diversity and inclusion goals following an internal review of its policies, practices, and the US landscape, according to a memo sent by Chief Executive Julie Sweet to company employees on Thursday.

The company will start phasing out its 2017 diversity goals, which include career development programs for people from specific demographic groups, the memo said.

Additionally, Accenture will stop reporting data to external diversity benchmarking surveys, Sweet said in the memo.

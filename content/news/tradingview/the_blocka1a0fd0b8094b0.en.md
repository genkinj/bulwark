U.S. investment manager VanEck forecasted that Solana's price could reach $520 by the end of 2025. “Using an autoregressive (AR) forecast model, we estimate Solana’s market cap will reach ~$250B, implying a SOL price of $520 based on ~486M floating tokens,” VanEck said in a Thursday post on the social media platform X.

According to The Block’s crypto price page, Solana is currently trading at $195.5 — falling 3.5% in the past 24 hours. A target of $520 means that the token's price would increase by 165% this year. In the last 12 months, Solana has risen by 102%. It is the fifth largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of $94.1 billion.

“We value Solana (SOL) based on its projected year-end market share within the smart contract platform (SCP) market,” VanEck said. “Our SCP market cap forecast is derived from U.S. M2 money supply growth, given its strong historical correlation with crypto market capitalization.” M2 measures the U.S. money supply — encompassing cash, checking deposits, and readily convertible near-money, such as savings and money market accounts.

The investment firm said it projects the U.S. M2 to hit $22.3 trillion by the year-end with a 3.2% annualized growth rate, while the smart contract platform market is expected to expand 43% to an all-time high of $1.1 trillion during the period from $770 billion today. In the meantime, Solana’s share of the SCP market capitalization is predicted to grow from 15% to 22%, VanEck said. “This projection is supported by Solana’s developer dominance, increasing market share in DEX volumes, revenues, and active users,” the company said.

The Solana blockchain has experienced significant growth over the past year, fueled partly by the enduring popularity of Solana-based memecoins. At its recent height in November, the network saw over 135 million active wallet addresses, according to The Block’s data dashboard.

In its follow-up post, VanEck added a disclaimer that the investment firm has positions in Solana, and its price prediction is not a recommendation to purchase or sell the cryptocurrency. VanEck has also applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot exchange-traded fund based on Solana.

While the SEC had not previously formally acknowledged any filings for spot Solana ETFs, the agency issued a public notice Thursday soliciting comments on Grayscale's application for a Solana exchange-traded product.

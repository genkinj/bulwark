Dug Foodtech AB (publ)

DUG Foodtech announces listing with 150 Carrefour hypermarkets across Spain, with the first order of 0.4 MSEK completed. This collaboration represents the first steps to enter the Spanish market and the strategic focus on the European market.

Spain is the second-largest plant-based market in Europe. Between 2021 and 2023, sales of plant-based milk and drinks in Spain grew by 12% to €308 million, with unit sales up 9.3% and volume increasing by 11.3%. Early 2024 data indicates this growth is continuing, with sales value, unit sales, and volume all rising steadily. \*

Carrefour, one of Europe’s largest retail chains, operates more than 1,500 hypermarkets worldwide, with a robust presence in Spain. Known for its commitment to offering diverse, high-quality products, Carrefour provides an ideal platform for DUG to reach a broader audience of health-conscious consumers.

“Spain, as the second-largest non-dairy market in Europe, presents an exciting opportunity for us. Alongside this retail partnership, we are also launching into the coffee channel, further expanding our footprint,” says Helene Nielsen, CEO of DUG Foodtech.

This information is such that DUG Foodtech AB (publ) is obligated to disclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact person set out above on February 7, 2025, at 16:05 CEST.

The European Commission approved the joint venture between Germany's Yunex GmbH, Via Verde Portugal - Gestão de Sistemas Electrónicos de Cobrança, and Ascendi O&M.

The commission found that the partnership focusing on toll motorway concessions and the distribution of onboard equipment poses would not raise competition concerns as it has negligible activities in the European Economic Area, according to a Friday release. It also took into account the parties' limited combined market position after the deal.

Amid the announcement of the Bank of England’s dovish rate cut, the bank also released its Decision Maker Panel survey (DMP) – closely watched by officials – which showed further signs of weakness in the labour market.

This not only backs the case for more cuts but opens the door to a faster pace of easing than the quarterly rate cut base case.

According to the DMP survey, realised employment growth contracted for the first time since August 2021 at -0.5%, while expected employment growth fell for the second time in three months.

Given the well-known quality issues with the UK’s national labour market statistics, which continues to suffer from low response rates, alternative data sources such as the DMP survey will step up in importance for BoE officials in determining the appropriate course of policy action to take.

On the inflation front, CPI one-year and three-year expectations continued to hover around the high 2s to 3% mark, though still point towards a broader downtrend. Meanwhile, realised wage growth fell 0.2 percentage points to 5.1%.

For sterling, in light of the BoE’s dovish rate cut, where two officials opted for a 50bp cut, the currency is likely to be more sensitive to incoming data, particularly with the increased risk that policymakers may shift away from cutting at a quarterly pace to back-to-back meetings instead. In turn, the weaker growth picture for the UK is likely to remain a headwind for GBP going forward.

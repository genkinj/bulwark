The Ibovespa fell 0.4% to below the 126,000 level on Friday, heading for a flat weekly performance under pressure from major financial institutions.

Despite strong earnings, Bradesco shares dropped over 2% as the bank signaled a slowdown in credit, weighing on other key lenders, including Santander, which also lost more than 2%.

Additionally, a lower-than-expected US unemployment figure gave the Federal Reserve room to delay further rate cuts, pressuring risk assets.

Other notable declines were seen in JBS, Rumo Logística, BRF, and CCR, all losing over 1%.

Meanwhile, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad stressed that monetary policy must be applied wisely to avoid pushing the economy into recession.

This comes as, under Gabriel Galípolo's leadership, with most directors appointed by President Lula, the central bank raised the Selic rate by 1 percentage point to 13.25% in January and signaled a similar increase in March.

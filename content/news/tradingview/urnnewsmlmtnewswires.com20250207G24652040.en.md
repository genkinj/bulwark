RBC Capital Markets maintained its sector perform rating on Equinor , with a price target of 300 Norwegian kroner, while adjusting its estimates following the energy giant's strategic update.

"Equinor's strategic update effectively formalises a previously flagged slowdown in offshore wind activity, with the company acknowledging the slowing pace of the energy transition," analysts said Thursday. "The backbone of the business in Norway continues to perform well, while growth in the international segment should come through over the coming years. We balance the lower near-term spend against the valuation, as well as the M&A (Orsted) overhang."

The research firm raised its production numbers and slightly upgraded its EPS estimates for 2025 and 2026, although it remains cautious on the company's near-term prospects.

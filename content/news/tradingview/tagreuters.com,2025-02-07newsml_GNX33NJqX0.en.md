- Product has patent protection through 2044 -

- Expected to be listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Orange Book upon the product’s approval –

DEER PARK, Ill., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or the “Company”) , an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted the Company U.S. Patent No. 12,214,010, covering its ET-600 product candidate’s proprietary formulation of desmopressin oral solution. The patent expires in 2044 and is expected to be listed in the FDA Orange Book upon the product’s approval. The Company has an additional patent application related to the product under review with the USPTO.

ET-600 is a proprietary formulation of desmopressin oral solution under development for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin is the standard of care for diabetes insipidus, but there is not an FDA-approved oral liquid formulation. Currently, desmopressin is only FDA-approved in injectable, tablet, and nasal form, none of which fully meet the pediatric need for small, precise, and titratable doses. As a result, most pediatric patients use unapproved liquid suspensions from compounding pharmacies, attempt to cut and measure fractional tablets, or take daily injections.

“This patent strengthens our growing intellectual property portfolio and underscores our commitment to delivering innovative treatments to underserved patient populations. The pediatric endocrinology community has expressed the significant need for a liquid form of desmopressin that can accurately and efficiently deliver small doses for children, and we are proud to have developed a formulation to meet their needs and to see our innovation recognized with a patent,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals.

ET-600 previously passed a pilot bioequivalence study in 2024 and is currently undergoing its pivotal bioequivalence study. The Company expects to have study results at the end of February. If results are positive, the company anticipates filing a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA for the product by the second quarter of 2025.

Legal & General Group agreed to sell its US protection unit and a 20% stake in its pension risk transfer business to Japanese Insurer Meiji Yasuda for a combined equity value of $2.3 billion, payable in cash at closing.

The deal is anticipated to be finalized towards the end of 2025, with Meiji Yasuda also planning to acquire a 5% shareholding in the British financial services company, according to a Friday release.

Legal & General plans to use 400 million pounds sterling to finance the reinsurance arrangement for the US Pension Risk Transfer business, return 1 billion pounds to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, and the remaining to support its growth strategy.

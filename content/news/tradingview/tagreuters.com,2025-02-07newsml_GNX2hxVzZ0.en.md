NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Track Group, Inc. (OTCQB: TRCK), a global leader in offender tracking and monitoring services, today announced financial results for its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 (“Q1 FY25”). In Q1 FY25, the Company posted (i) total revenue of $8.7 Million (“M”), a decrease of approximately 3.3% over total revenue of $9.0M for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 (“Q1 FY24”); (ii) Q1 FY25 operating income of $0.1M compared to Q1 FY24 operating loss of ($0.2M); and (iii) net loss attributable to common shareholders of ($2.0M) in Q1 FY25 compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.1M in Q1 FY24.

“The quarter ending December 31, 2024 showed increases in gross profit, operating income and Adjusted EBITDA. This progress reflects the increased use of our products and services in legacy programs and continued expansion through newly awarded contracts domestically and abroad. With a strong pipeline and a commitment to delivering value, we are poised for continued success in fiscal year 2025,” said Derek Cassell, Track Group’s CEO.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

* Total Q1 FY25 revenue of $8.7M decreased approximately 3.3% compared to Q1 FY24 revenue of $9.0M. The decrease in revenue was driven principally by a decrease in people assigned to monitoring for clients in Michigan and Virginia, and our recently sold Chilean subsidiary. This decrease was partially offset by revenue increases for clients in Illinois, Puerto Rico and the Bahamas who experienced increases in the number of people assigned to monitoring.
* Gross profit of $4.4M in Q1 FY25 increased approximately 5.2% compared to Q1 FY24 gross profit of $4.2M due to a decrease in monitoring center costs, partially offset by a decrease in revenue.
* Operating income in Q1 FY25 of $0.1M increased compared to the operating loss of ($0.2M) in Q1 FY24. The increase in net income in Q1 FY25 is primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenue and a decrease in operating expense.
* Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 FY25 of $1.2M, increased compared to $1.1M for Q1 FY24 due to an increase in operating income and gross profit. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 FY25 as a percentage of revenue increased to 14.4%, compared to 11.8% for Q1 FY24 for the same reasons.
* Unrestricted cash balance of $3.7M for Q1 FY25 increased compared to $3.6M for Q1 FY24. The change in cash position was principally due to the sale of our Chilean subsidiary.
* Net loss attributable to shareholders in FY24 was ($2,010,849) compared to net income of $461 in FY23, a change principally attributable to lower revenue and a foreign currency exchange rate loss.

**Business Outlook**

Growth in gross profit and operating income in Q1 FY25 reinforces our confidence in the strategic reinvestment in technology and the implementation of new programs initiated in late FY23. These endeavors position us well for sustained growth throughout FY25. As a result, the Company's preliminary outlook for FY25 is as follows:

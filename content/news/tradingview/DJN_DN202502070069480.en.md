Base metal prices rise, with LME three-month copper up 2.1% at $9,482 a metric ton and LME three-month aluminum up 0.55% at $2,639 a ton. Copper now stands at a three-month high as market participants digest the first exchange of tariffs between the U.S. and China, with hopes that a trade conflict will be less serious than previously feared, Commerzbank analysts say in a note. Chinese participants have also returned to the market with vigor after the Lunar New Year celebrations and demand is brisk, which has also boosted copper price, Commerzbank says. The metal's gains also appear to reflect particularly high demand in the U.S. due to fears of tariffs, as a significant premium is still being paid on the U.S. commodities exchange Comex compared to the LME, Commerzbank adds.

The South African rand hovered around 18.4 per USD, its highest level in two weeks, amid a softer dollar and as investors digested the President Cyril Ramaphosa’s first national address under the new coalition government.

He laid out plans for infrastructure investment, committing ZAR 900 billion over the next three years to stimulate economic growth and job creation, with a target to push growth beyond 3%.

Revitalizing state-owned entities like Eskom and Transnet will be key to this initiative.

The speech also carried geopolitical undertones, with Ramaphosa asserting South Africa’s resilience, declaring, "We will not be bullied," in the context of rising tensions with the US and Rwanda over land expropriation.

Meanwhile, market participants closely monitored any developments regarding Trump’s policies, as recent US actions have exerted pressure on emerging-market currencies.

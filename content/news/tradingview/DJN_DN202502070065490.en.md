The surprise strength in Canadian hiring last month included a lift in manufacturing employment. That may not be surprising given signs the sector has perked up of late, but it worth noting given manufacturing accounts for 8.9% of total Canadian employment and the sector has dependencies on U.S. demand. Statistics Canada estimates 641,000 sector jobs, or 39.4% of total work in manufacturing depend on the U.S. demand for Canada's exports. In the auto-making segment, which is tightly integrated with U.S. supply chains, an estimated 68.3% of jobs depend on U.S. demand for exports. Food manufacturing is less reliant on foreign demand, though 28.8% of jobs in the sector depend on America's demand for Canadian exports. (robb.stewart@wsj.com; @RobbMStewart)

PRISTINA (Kosovo), February 7 (SeeNews) - The European Central Bank (ECB) has granted an extension of a temporary repo line for the central bank of Kosovo by two years, until January 31, 2027, Kosovo's central bank said on Friday.

The extension grants access to a 100 million euro ($103.8 million) liquidity line, unchanged compared with the previous agreement, the central bank said in a press release.

"Although the CBK has not utilized the REPO Line it views this instrument as crucial for ensuring the monetary and financial stability of Kosovo, particularly in light of global uncertainties and their potential risks to economies and financial markets," Kosovo's central bank said.

The repo line was first established in 2020 as part of a larger initiative to support institutions in non-euro area central banks, in view of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the ECB has said.

In 2022, the Kosovo repo line was extended until January 2024, and in January 2024, it was extended until January 2025.

Under a repo line, a national central bank can borrow euro from the ECB up to a specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral, aiming to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions.

MEXICO CITY--Mexico's inflation eased to a four-year low in January as lower fresh-food prices and a seasonal decline in some services offset increases in core goods prices.

The consumer price index rose 0.29% last month, bringing the 12-month inflation rate down to 3.59% from 4.21% in December, statistics institute Inegi said Friday. Core CPI, which excludes energy and agricultural prices, rose 0.41% in January and was up 3.66% from a year earlier, practically unchanged from the end of last year.

Higher prices for gasoline, diners and cigarettes were offset in January by a drop in fruit and vegetable prices, and in services such as airfares and vacation packages following the holiday season.

With inflation at its lowest level since January of 2021, the Bank of Mexico on Thursday reduced its benchmark interest rate by half of a percentage point to 9.5% after four consecutive quarter-point reductions. The central bank, which is also concerned about the slowdown in economic growth, said more half-point cuts are possible at future meetings.

The central bank expects inflation to ease gradually to its 3% target in the third quarter of 2026.

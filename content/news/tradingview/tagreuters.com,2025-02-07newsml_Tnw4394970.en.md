February 7, 2025, TORONTO, ON –TheNewswire – Star Royalties Ltd. (“StarRoyalties”, or the “Company”) (TSXV: STRR, OTCQX: STRFF) is pleased tohighlight the completion of Minera Alamos Inc.’s (“Minera Alamos”) (TSXV: MAI, OTCQX:MAIFF) previously announced acquisition of Sabre Gold Mines Corp.(“Sabre Gold”) (TSX: SGLD,OTCQB: SGLDF). The acquisition provides a direct and acceleratedpathway to bring the Copperstone Gold Mine (“Copperstone”) into production inthe first half of 2026. The Company's existing gold streamingagreement on Copperstone remains a flat 4% of gold produced for theduration of Copperstone’s life-of-mine (“LOM”). Under the terms of thestreaming agreement, Star Royalties will provide a cash payment toMinera Alamos equal to 25% of the spot gold price for each ounce ofgold delivered. All amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwiseindicated.

Transaction Highlights

* Accelerated timeline to production atCopperstone: With the acquisition of Sabre Goldnow complete, Copperstone has become a priority development projectfor Minera Alamos. Minera Alamos is in the process of expanding itsconstruction and operations team, and management plans for firstproduction in the first half of 2026.
* Proven mine builders and operators:Minera Alamos’ established track record ofpermitting, building, and operating gold mines will be a key driver toreturning Copperstone to production within established timelines andcost estimates. The management team has set several milestones for2025, including re-issuing a Preliminary Economic Assessment(“PEA”), installing process plant equipment, and rehabilitatingunderground infrastructure.
* Increased confidence in developmentcost estimates: Minera Alamos management expectsthat the use of already-owned process plant equipment and leveragingexisting infrastructure should offset inflationary pressures to thepre-production capital of approximately $36 million as contemplated inthe June 2023 PEA. Minera Alamos is reviewing transportation proposalsfor relocating the process plant equipment that is currently instorage in Quebec to Copperstone.
* Upcoming PEA to highlight projecteconomics and stream value at current gold prices: Minera Alamos indicated that it will be re-issuing the 2023Copperstone PEA, with previous operating assumptions and a gold pricesensitivity table that will reflect current gold price assumptions. Asper the current Copperstone’s PEA and assuming a gold price ofUS$2,800/oz, Star Royalties’ stream is expected to generateapproximately US$19.2 million in LOM pre-tax cash flow prior to anysuccessful mine-life extension from resource conversion andexploration upside.
* Equityownership of Sabre Gold converted at a premium with improveddiversification: The Company’s equity positionin Sabre Gold of 7,407,407 shares, has beenconverted into 5,133,333 shares of Minera Alamos. The equity ownershipconversion diversifies the Company’s exposure from a single-assetdeveloper in Sabre Gold to a portfolio of operating anddevelopment-stage projects in Minera Alamos.
* C$2.0 million in contingent paymentsconverted to Minera Alamos equity: TheCompany’s outstanding C$2.0 million payments owed by Sabre Gold havebeen converted into an additional 4,459,459 shares of Minera Alamos asa result of the share exchange process detailed in Sabre Gold’s newsrelease dated October 28, 2024.

Alex Pernin, Chief Executive Officer of Star Royalties, commented:“We congratulate Minera Alamos on their successful acquisition ofSabre Gold and we look forward to what should be a highly productiveand milestone-rich 2025 as Copperstone is brought forward toproduction. Achieving gold production in the coming quarters willgenerate significant value for our investment and for ourshareholders, especially in today’s record-high gold priceenvironment. In addition to Copperstone’s development plan, asMinera Alamos derisks its remaining portfolio and advances itspipeline, we continue to see meaningful re-rating potential for the9.6 million Minera Alamos shares we now own through this acquisition.This Minera Alamos equity improves the long-term liquidity andstrength of our balance sheet. Once again, the completion of thistransaction cements value for our Copperstone stream, but alsomeaningfully rerates and derisks our mining royalty portfolio as awhole. We believe it is an important step in closing the valuation gapimplied by our share price to the value of our underlying miningroyalty portfolio.”

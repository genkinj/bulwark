Porsche AG expects an up to 800 million-euro financial impact in 2025 from its plan to boost short- and medium-term profitability, according to a late Thursday release.

The supervisory board-approved long-term proposal includes new models with more combustion or plug-in hybrid engines and an expansion of the group's vehicle customization programs. It also involves a restructuring of its corporate organization.

The company expects these measures to affect its operating profit and automotive net cash flow.

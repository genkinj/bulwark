\*\* Shares of makeup company Elf Beauty fall ~27% to $64.88 premarket

\*\* Company cuts its annual net sales and profit forecasts, citing weak demand in mass beauty category at the start of the year

\*\* Demand was softer in mass beauty channel in January, and some of Elf's newer products were "off to a slower start", CEO Tarang Amin tells Reuters

\*\* Jefferies cuts PT to $110 from $175 and D.A. Davidson slashes to $80 from $170

\*\* Elf's Q3 sales beat estimates by a large margin but new guidance seens conservative, say J.P.Morgan analysts; cut PT to $127 from $163

\*\* Adds that it seems that the core ELF consumer became even more cautious in light of the macro-political events

\*\* Elf stock had fallen 13% in 2024

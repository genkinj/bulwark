US gasoline futures rose toward $2.10 per gallon in February, tracking higher oil prices and expectations of tighter global supply.

The US escalated sanctions on Iran earlier in the week, potentially restricting its oil flows, while Saudi Aramco sharply raised March crude prices, driven by rising demand from China and India, as well as supply disruptions from Russia.

Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service is expected to ban gasoline exports for at least a month to stabilize wholesale prices, adding further pressure to oil markets.

Market sentiment remained cautious due to trade tensions, with China retaliating against US tariffs by imposing levies on American coal, LNG, and crude oil, heightening concerns over reduced global demand.

However, the market faced additional pressure from EIA data showing a larger-than-expected build in US gasoline stocks, which grew by 2.233 million barrels—well above the forecasted 1.2 million increase.

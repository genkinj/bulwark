The latest Market Talks covering FX and Fixed Income. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires throughout the day.

1048 ET - The 10-year Treasury climbs back to 4.5% territory as fresh data bolster bets on a hawkish Fed. January jobs report showed a small decline on unemployment and firmer-than-expected earnings, while the University of Michigan confidence index fell unexpected to 67.8, its lowest level since June. Inflation expectations in the survey jumped to 4.3% from 3.3%. Markets are pricing 53% odds that the Fed will cut only once, or not at all, this year, according to CME data. That's up from 42% yesterday. The 10-year is at 4.506% and the two-year at 4.281%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1038 ET - Job creation in Canada has picked up strongly, with the 3-month average of 70,000 the fastest pace in almost two years, says TD Securities. January's jobs data indicates hiring in the goods-producing sector was the best one-month performance since 2006, when the pandemic era is excluded. Hiring was powered by manufacturing, and the firm acknowledges some of the job gains at factories was likely tied to ramped up production stemming from the risk of hefty US tariffs. TD believes a Bank of Canada rate cut is still in order for March, but the economy would have to materially slow to justify further rate cuts in 2Q. (paul.vieira@wsj.com, @paulvieira)

1036 ET - Another round of firm looking Canadian labor market data reduces the urgency for a March rate cut from the Bank of Canada, which had signaled any further moves would be contingent on economic data continuing to look soft, says Royal Bank of Canada's Nathan Janzen. The job market surprised to the upside for a second straight month, with employment rising solidly and the jobless rate unexpectedly slipping. Still, Janzen says it may be too early to give labor markets the all clear--the unemployment rate is still up almost a percentage point from a year ago and wage growth slowed. The economist says there also remains an uncertain economic backdrop and the significant risk of U.S. tariffs, which could be announced before the BoC's next policy meeting.

1020 ET - There was little to disappoint in Canada's January jobs numbers, with employment rising a much stronger-than-expected 76,000 and total hours worked climbing 0.9% on-month, which bodes well for 1Q GDP, Capital Economics' Thomas Ryan says. The economist says the details of the labor survey also were encouraging, with a solid rise in private-sector employment driving most of the gains. A smaller increase in the population for the month is another sign the government's new immigration policies are having an effect, he adds. Ryan says that overall it lowers the odds the Bank of Canada will again cut rates in March, though with tariffs still looming he expects the bank to err on the dovish side and reduce the policy rate a further quarter percentage point.

1006 ET - January payrolls show U.S. labor markets somewhat tighter than expected, but not enough to challenge Fed Chair Powell's view that the labor market hasn't been a source of inflationary pressure, AllianceBernstein's Eric Winograd says. Payrolls declined to 143,000 from 307,000, but unemployment slipped to 4% from 4.1% while wage growth accelerated. Winograd says, however, that the data has been steady and consistent for several months. "There isn't anything in there that suggests the labor market is putting significant upward pressure on inflation," he says. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

1002 ET - The Swiss franc could appreciate in coming months as the Swiss National Bank is unlikely to return to negative interest rates, Commerzbank analyst Michael Pfister says in a note. The SNB will probably end its rate-cutting cycle with a policy rate of 0.0%, compared to 0.5% currently, he says. Inflation has eased but should stabilize above the lower limit of the SNB's 0%-2% target range. Switzerland's economic growth also continues to be much stronger than of the eurozone. At the same time, global uncertainties "will not disappear completely this year" and this should drive safe-haven flows to the franc. Commerzbank expects EUR/CHF to fall to 0.91 by year-end, from 0.9424 currently. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0957 ET - For the November-to-January period, employment in Canada rises 211,000, or an average 70,000 a month--the type of job creation that's generally tied to period of healthy growth, says BMO Capital Markets economist Doug Porter. The January data were full of strong underlying details, from a hefty 0.9% rise in hours worked and 57,000 rise in private-sector employment. "If we weren't all absorbed with the possibility of a trade war, we would be talking about the comeback in the Canadian domestic economy in recent months," Porter writes, adding this is yet another sign that aggressive rate cuts last year are beginning to bear fruit. However, the prospect of trade conflict will hover over Canada, so that keeps the possibility alive for another rate cut in March. (Paul.Vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

0948 ET - Yields on U.K. government bonds rise, tracking U.S. Treasury yields, following U.S. non-farm payrolls data. These showed a resilient labor market and increased the chances of U.S. interest rates staying higher for longer. The U.S unemployment rate fell to 4.0% in January from 4.1% in December, even as non-farm payrolls came in at 143,000, weaker than the 169,000 forecast by economists in a WSJ poll. "With the unemployment rate at just 4%...the Fed will be on hold for several more months," says ING economist James Knightley in a note. The 10-year gilt yield rises to 4.491%, from 4.448% before the data, Tradeweb data show. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbs to 4.493%, from 4.446% prior to the data. (miriam.mukuru@wsj.com)

0941 ET - The dollar reacted modestly to the latest U.S. jobs data as the figures are unlikely to alter the market's Federal Reserve interest rate expectations, XTB's Kathleen Brooks says in a note. Nonfarm payrolls were weaker than predicted in January but the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and wage growth exceeded forecasts. Downgrades to annual benchmark revisions weren't sizeable, suggesting the labor market remains strong with only a mild softening, she says. "We do not think that the labor market data shifts the dial for the Fed." The DXY dollar index rises 0.1% to 107.830, compared to 107.810 before the data. (renae.dyer@wsj.com)

0935 ET - Investors are boosting the odds of a longer pause on interest rate cuts by the Fed, following January payrolls. Although job creation declined to 143,000 from 307,000, past figures were revised up. The unemployment rate surprisingly declined to 4% from 4.1% and earnings growth accelerated, all giving reasons to believe the Fed would refrain from cutting for a while. A hold in March is now priced at 91% odds, up from 84% yesterday, on the CME's FedWatch tool. Odds of only one cut or less by December are 49%, up from 42%. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

0930 ET - Solid Canadian job growth in January gives the Bank of Canada some flexibility should President Trump refrain from hefty tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports in early March, says Desjardins Group economist Royce Mendes. Canada added a net 76,000 jobs, well above market expectations, with most of the hiring in the private sector. The unemployment rate fell again, to 6.6% in January after peaking at 6.9% in November. Absent hefty tariffs, Mendes says BOC might choose to keep its policy rate unchanged in March, noting BOC Gov. Tiff Macklem delivered "somewhat hawkish" remarks Thursday at a conference hosted by Bank for International Settlements. (paul.vieira@wsj.com; @paulvieira)

0930 ET - Revisions in payrolls data show stronger job creation than previously reported, indicating that U.S. labor markets are tighter than the January report could imply. Last month's payrolls were 143,000, while economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast 169,000. But the December figure was revised up by 51,000 to 307,000. November's was adjusted upward by 49,000 to 261,000. Average hourly earnings growth accelerated to 0.5% from 0.3%, taking the annual gain slightly above 4%. Economists expected a slowdown on earnings. (paulo.trevisani@wsj.com; @ptrevisani)

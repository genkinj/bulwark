China's foreign-exchange reserves rose in January, after falling in December as the dollar index weakened, according to official data released Friday.

The nation's reserves of foreign currency rose by $6.68 billion to $3.209 trillion as of the end of January, said the People's Bank of China.

That handily beat the $2 billion increase expected by economists in a Wall Street Journal survey.

The PBOC's data also showed that the central bank had increased its gold holdings for a third month to 73.45 million fine troy ounces in January, compared with 73.29 million in December.

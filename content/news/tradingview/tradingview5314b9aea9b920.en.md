Consumers Bancorp Inc., a prominent player in the commercial and retail banking sector, has released its Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the company's financial and operational performance, showcasing significant growth in key financial metrics and stable business operations across its primary market areas.

**Financial Highlights**

**Total Interest and Dividend Income:** Consumers Bancorp reported a total interest and dividend income of $13.215 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024. This marks an increase driven by higher average interest-earning assets and elevated market interest rates.

**Net Interest Income:** The net interest income for the same period was $8.319 million, reflecting a 4.5% increase from the prior year period. This growth was primarily due to a $35.9 million rise in average interest-earning assets.

**Net Income:** The company achieved a net income of $2.287 million for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to $2.015 million for the same period in 2023, indicating improved profitability.

**Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share:** Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were $0.73, up from $0.65 in the prior year period, reflecting the higher net income.

**Net Interest Margin:** The net interest margin stood at 3.02% for the three months ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2.95% for the same period in 2023, attributed to increased yields on interest-earning assets.

**Business Highlights**

**Revenue Segments:** Consumers Bancorp's operations are primarily focused on commercial and retail banking, which account for substantially all of its revenues, operating income, and assets. The bank attracts deposits from businesses and individual customers and uses these deposits to originate commercial, mortgage, and consumer loans in its primary market area.

**Geographical Performance:** The bank operates in Carroll, Columbiana, Jefferson, Mahoning, Stark, Summit, and contiguous counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The performance in these regions is driven by the bank's ability to attract deposits and originate loans.

**Sales Units:** Total loans increased by $3,681, or an annualized 1.0%, from June 30, 2024, primarily within the consumer loan portfolio due to the expansion of the indirect dealer network.

**Future Outlook:** Management expects the cost of funds to trend downward in future quarters due to easing competitive pressures on deposit pricing and recent reductions in the discount rate. The company also anticipates improved financial performance from a commercial customer due to completed construction projects and cost-saving measures.

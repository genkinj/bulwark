HSBC is looking into cutting its chief executive officer Georges Elhedery's fixed pay by half Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The potential pay reduction came after the UK removed limits for banker bonus payments to be just twice the base salary, the report said.

Elhedery currently receives up to 10.6 million pounds sterling in remuneration package, comprising a base salary of 1.38 million pounds, a fixed pay allowance of 1.7 million pounds, an annual incentive, a long-term award, and a pension allowance, the report said.

Under the new plan, Elhedery will get a fixed pay of about half of its current value but his bonus could be potentially much higher, taking his package to as much as 15 million pounds, the report said, citing the person.

An HSBC representative said no decisions have been made, but the remuneration committee aims to align executive pay with performance and shareholder interests, according to the report.

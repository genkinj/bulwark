TWL is facing a tax bill of 36 million Malaysian ringgit after receiving assessment notices from the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia.

The notices cover the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023, according to a Bursa Malaysia filing on Thursday.

The additional taxes and penalties are due to deemed interest charges and the rejection of employee share option scheme expenses.

TWL, citing legal advice, argues that the assessments were incorrectly imposed and has filed for judicial review at the High Court of Malaya.

Following a hearing on Jan. 22, the court granted an interim stay on the enforcement of the notices pending the disposal of the leave application.

A case management hearing is slated for Feb. 26, the filing said.

China's equity market has yet to reflect the country's improving innovation capability and looks due for a rerating driven by the global attention on DeepSeek, HSBC analysts say in a research note. China's stock markets have so far been relatively unaffected by the additional 10% U.S. tariffs, which are well within market expectations, they say. HSBC estimates a 0.5% hit to net profits of CSI 300 companies for every 10% tariff increase on Chinese goods. Chinese companies with extensive overseas businesses have built factories outside the mainland and are therefore better positioned, the analysts say. Meanwhile, they note that China's economy showed more signs of a recovery during the Lunar New Year holidays, with the property market improving and overall holiday traffic volumes growing steadily.

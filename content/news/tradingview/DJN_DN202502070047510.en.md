Bill Holdings shares dived 28% in premarket trading after its revenue guidance for the current quarter came in below Wall Street's prediction.

Shares were trading around $69.28. The stock is up 47% over the last year.

The business-assistance software company forecast third-quarter revenue between $352.5 million and $357.5 million. This was below the average consensus forecast of revenue around $360.3 million, according to analysts polled by FactSet prior to Thursday's announcement.

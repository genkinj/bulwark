**The data centre will commence operations in 2026.**

[Singtel’s data centre arm, Nxera DCT](https://sbr.com.sg/telecom-internet/news/singtels-nxera-and-malaysias-tm-partner-data-centre-development), has secured a $643m five-year green loan to finance the development of DC Tuas, a new 58MW data centre in Singapore.

Set to be operational in 2026, DC Tuas will be Singapore’s most hyper-connected green data centre with the highest power density.

It will support growing enterprise demand for high-quality, sustainable digital infrastructure while optimising land, power, and water use. The facility will also offer a high-density environment suited for AI workloads and operate at a Power Usage Effectiveness of below 1.25 at full load.

In addition, the data centre will integrate next-generation cooling capable of supporting computing power of more than 30kW per rack, featuring a highly efficient chilled water system and water recycling technology for maximum water efficiency.

As part of the green loan criteria, DC Tuas has achieved Green Mark Platinum certification.

“Sustainability is a core part of our data centre business, and we are committed to developing and growing the industry’s most sustainable, next-generation digital assets. This loan will enable us to support Singapore’s digital economy while reducing our carbon footprint in keeping with our net zero goals,” Arthur Lang, Singtel group CFO said.

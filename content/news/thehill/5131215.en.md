Never let them tell you that nothing ever changes in politics.

In 1996, [just 27 percent of American adults](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.gallup.com%2Fpoll%2F1651%2Fgay-lesbian-rights.aspx&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617128808%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=ZOUqH%2F077xY2z4aTrmlzX%2BaSozJE3YtnLz%2BOszVODrg%3D&reserved=0) believed that the law should recognize same-sex marriages.

A decade later, at about the time the U.S. Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal in all the land, support was at 46 percent, with the opposition still holding on to a solid majority.

Last year, it was 69 percent in favor, 29 percent opposed — an almost perfect reversal of where the issue stood 28 years before.

There was no precipitating event of the kind that has driven other massive swings in popular opinion, in the way that 9/11 changed opinions on the threat of terrorism or how the financial panic of 2008 altered the view of the banking system.

And yet, I am unaware of any shift of similar size on a difficult social issue in such a short period of time, especially in a successful cause; [not desegregation](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.norc.org%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fnorc-org%2Fpdfs%2FNORCRpt_119.pdf&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617168245%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=taUNfHiOb5qV4UpQurtXJn1gh92LVlVhKvOmCD5UGgI%3D&reserved=0), [not women’s rights](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aei.org%2Fpolitics-and-public-opinion%2Fwomen-making-history-polls-on-the-equal-right-amendment%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617193159%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OGUXcZZAzN%2FaIr4DSwnOTsylj2Vt2fy99OL6pXfbt0s%3D&reserved=0).

A backlash against efforts to enshrine restrictions in other states after the Massachusetts Supreme Court allowed it in 2003?

All of that and more no doubt played its part in the most successful social movement of my lifetime — a movement so successful that conservative Republicans now take pride in the fact that the new Treasury secretary is a [gay, married father of two](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2015%2F6%2F26%2F8851503%2Fgay-marriage-andrew-sullivan&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617246202%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fg7ubAXONDVjO0o8R%2B%2FKiRGjfgRmfZf%2FXYQPe3Dh1%2BE%3D&reserved=0). A dozen years ago, the progressive Democrat newly sworn in as president was publicly opposed to gay marriage. What a whirlwind romance.

As the success of the gay rights movement was reaching its zenith, transgender rights emerged among activists as the logical next step for the cause. Many of the notes were the same as when the gay rights crusade began at the end of the 1960s: a marginalized minority pushing an unpopular cause against a dominant culture uncomfortable with the change. Fighting for transgender adults to live with peace and dignity seemed a just cause for what, by then, had expanded to be known as the LGBTQ community.

There were many avenues for the new effort, including those less controversial ones, like the successful bid to [extend equal rights protections](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2020%2F06%2F15%2F863498848%2Fsupreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617266074%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=sv2%2F5eRJ3HqYQYDuw9WqGRjOLQBEuNv2ABsdOlFLMbo%3D&reserved=0) to transgender workers and citizens.

But it has been in sports where we have seen the highest profile battles play out. Arguably the most famous transgender American is Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, Kardashian stepdad and the greatest track and field star of the 1970s.

A new poll conducted for [The New York Times](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic01.nyt.com%2Fnewsgraphics%2Fdocumenttools%2Ff548560f100205ef%2Fe656ddda-full.pdf&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617340837%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=uNCrovSI8cJCt0mGj7feItnRPiz6Mg1M4PikRaUnqEk%3D&reserved=0) by Ipsos found relatively little enthusiasm for Trump himself as his second term gets underway, and staunch opposition for some of his pet projects, like the three-quarters of respondents (including 58 percent of Republicans) who opposed Trump investigating or prosecuting his political opponents.

But on a host of issues, like mass deportations of recent migrants, international disengagement and rooting out government waste, Trump’s agenda had supermajority support, including substantial numbers of self-identified Democrats.

No area shows a more stark or bipartisan alignment than transgender issues.

While a big plurality of 49 percent agreed with the statement “Society has gone too far in accommodating transgender people,” the majorities on specifics were sky-high.

Pollsters asked: “Thinking about transgender female athletes — meaning athletes who were male at birth but who currently identify as female … do you think they should or should not be allowed to compete in women’s sports?”

The response: 79 percent of respondents, including 67 percent of Democrats, opposed participation.

Pollsters asked: “Thinking about medications used for transgender care, do you think doctors should be able to prescribe puberty-blocking drugs or hormone therapy to minors between the ages of 10 and 18?”

The response: 71 percent of all respondents said no one under 18 should have access to these drugs, including 54 percent of Democrats.

Time will tell if we look back on these numbers a decade from now the way Americans of 2015 could see the attitudes of the late 1990s on gay marriage. Perhaps it will be said that this moment was one of overreach followed by retrenchment before a new advance. Or, perhaps, it will be said that the frenzied focus on trans issues of the 2010s and 2020s was a passing moment and that the issue returns to one of narrow interest.

But it will definitely be said that this was one where Democrats misread the electorate, including their own voters. And it’s not like this is the first indication they had.

Polls [throughout the election year and before](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.gallup.com%2Fpoll%2F645704%2Fslim-majority-adults-say-changing-gender-morally-wrong.aspx&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617355750%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=H7yOxKhIuqCd5wZsBiZxaTMl6PloHwA4jbCLmiadocg%3D&reserved=0) made it plain that there was limited support for trans women in women’s sports and medical interventions for minors. But the new Times poll is an exclamation point after the election results making it clear that Democrats have been out of step. [Even if activists aren’t ready to hear it](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2024%2F11%2F16%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Fdemocrats-transgender-rights-moulton.html&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617370314%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=AX%2FZKrUm3cgYDyBADBBV3zVjOpFSBgXKPM4TNHtJwnk%3D&reserved=0).

This falls hard on those who sincerely believe that lives hang in the balance. It would take a heart of stone not to feel sympathy for those who see this as the human rights issue of our time to know that their cause is being shunned.

But it is just as clear that while there are lots of places for Democrats to dig in and fight Trump and improve their own miserably poor ratings, his new orders on transgender participation in sports and transgender treatments for minors are hardly the most fruitful ones.

**MAILBAG**

**“Being from West Virginia — Lewisburg in Greenbrier County — I find your idea to name your musings Whole Hog Politics to be a little amusing due to the fact that the media supporting the Deep State spent years ridiculing West Virginia’s Senator Saint Robert C. Byrd as the King of Pork. As anyway, welcome to the party, I just want to let you know you have joined a team at The Hill populated by the brightest, hardest working, and insightful young people ever assembled. Just to name a few: [**Alexis Simendinger**], [**Kristina Karisch**], [**Cate Martel**], [**Elizabeth Crisp**] and many, many more. So settle down into the easiest job you will ever have because your team is the best. Oh, and by the way, next spring when you go to stock up on ramps, take Route 60 west out of Rainelle, up to the top Swell Mountain, just as you pass the Loops Road on the left find a place to pull over (there is an old two story gas station store on the left side of the road). Hike up through the woods next to a gully and you will find some of the finest ramps. I think Westvaco owns the forest so don’t worry about getting shot for trespassing. Family has been getting ramps in that gully for fifty years.”** — *Lynn Gardner**,** Lewisburg, West Virginia*

  
Ms. Gardner,

I don’t think I ought to endorse any trespassing, even if it doesn’t cause one to get a side of buckshot along with their ramps! But I will allow that where I grew up, we did range and roam over hills and down creeks that were forgotten holdings of old and distant coal companies. I don’t suppose they missed the salamanders we took away.

As for the blessedness for Robert Byrd and his more than 51 years in the Senate, I would submit that if there is or was a “Deep State,” it was very favorably disposed to him. Byrd was the last of a breed: A former segregationist and Klansman who quickly and thoroughly made the switch to civil rights after Lyndon Johnson called the tune. Born into politics as a New Dealer, Byrd maintained an old bargain. He was an unsurpassed legislative operator who would employ his services for or against a bill for a price: the delivery of pork to West Virginia.

No state more than our own exemplified that old way of being. When socially conservative West Virginia was one of only 10 states that voted for Michael Dukakis in 1988, it wasn’t for his stances on crime and abortion. It was for the implied promise that Democrats would continue to push federal spending upwards and out to the states, with a preference for the poorest ones.

When I covered Byrd around the turn of the century, he had a standard line in his stump speeches: “West Virginians have always known that they could count on four things: The good Lord almighty, the Sears and Roebuck catalog, [Carter’s Little Liver Pills](https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.southernliving.com%2Fculture%2Fcarters-little-liver-pills&data=05%7C02%7Ciswanson%40thehill.com%7C9b30d456793b48fdd06708dd46eeb9a6%7C9e5488e2e83844f6886cc7608242767e%7C1%7C0%7C638744713617623049%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2FrES0U4baCo1hB2hYahYzWzM2okepqwEaMvcb6yO%2FAw%3D&reserved=0) and Robert Byrd.” His point was that the pills — a patent medicine used as a laxative — and the other three would all reliably deliver for the poor folks of the Mountain State.

Like the old practice of paying for votes, that version of politics held that voters should get something for providing their support. As Democrats moved left of most Appalachian voters, the money Byrd and his colleagues sent home was the recompense. People mean different things when they talk about the “Deep State,” but in my understanding of it, it is the permanent bureaucracy in Washington that grinds away at the core agenda of the agencies, an agenda that was substantially created, like Robert Byrd, by the ambitions of the New Deal and Great Society at home and a sort of bland internationalism abroad. All of that lined up very well with Byrd and his bargain.

The new administration has undertaken the work of blowing up what remains of the “Deep State” like nitroglycerin on a stump. This will bring pleasure to many of Byrd’s former constituents and lots of poor folks who are fed up with what they see as a rotten status quo. But I bet, in the end, we will arrive back at the old bargain in which federal largesse is delivered to soothe the anxieties of voters. Voters, especially poor ones, expect some consideration in exchange for their support.

And in addition to finding the best ramps between Meadow Bridge and Ravenseye, you also certainly know where to look for good reporters. I am indeed blessed to be working with such a fine crew at The Hill. I see many good things ahead as we build on an excellent foundation. Thank you for your encouragement and support.

Appropriationaly yours,

**“I am so tired of politics. I am so tired of the investigations being investigated. We have a bully and racist for president. I’m actually borderline scared how far this will go. Your column is welcoming. It makes me feel things aren’t sooooo bad. I think it’s well done and I enjoyed reading it.”** — *Sheila Hoover,San Luis Obispo, California*

  
Ms. Hoover,

If we do have a bully and a racist for a president it sure wouldn’t be the first time. Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon might all have been answerable to those charges, and that’s just limiting ourselves to the 20th century.

The issue before us right now is not principally the character of Donald Trump, which is exalted by his supporters, deplored by his opponents and generally disregarded by the plurality of the electorate. The matter now is whether the system Trump inherited is sufficient to permit the good parts to advance, curb the excesses and maintain power in the other branches.

We have had strong, bad men be president. We have had weak, good men. We have had Franklin Pierce, who seems to have been both weak and bad. The presidents who are both great and good are far fewer between. Abraham Lincoln and George Washington do not live on in our hearts and on our calendars because they were typical.

In these cases of the bullies that came before, periods of executive-branch abuse were all followed by a resurgence of small-R republican virtue. The Constitution does not automatically balance the power between the branches, rather it is by clashing and striving that they balance themselves. Our system was built to harness the human urge for dominion and prestige by setting it against the urges of other women and men. As James Madison, the architect of our republic wrote in Federalist 51: “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”

As Trump goes crashing through the barriers left to him by tradition and consensus, will Congress and the courts have ambition enough to put a leash on the presidency yet again? It may be unnerving to not fully know the answer to that question, but I would suggest that this is a reckoning long overdue in our badly imbalanced system.

I was so pleased to have your kind note and good words. May we continue to find a happy home with you.

Hopefully,

c

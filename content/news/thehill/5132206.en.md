House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) is holding his weekly press conference on Friday as President Trump’s foreign policy moves and a looming government shutdown [provide Democrats with ammo](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5123216-jeffries-government-shutdown-trump-orders/) to combat the administration’s early efforts to gut federal programs.

Jeffries earlier this week said the party would block any [funding proposals](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5129158-elon-musk-cms-access/) that freeze, slash or alter these programs, [such as](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5129158-elon-musk-cms-access/) Medicaid and Medicare. He has also pushed back against the president’s [recent suggestion](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127021-trump-us-takeover-gaza/) that the U.S. “take over” the war-torn Gaza Strip, with Jeffries instead [promoting](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5128344-hakeem-jeffries-trump-gaza/) more aid for Palestinians in the region and amplifying calls for a two-state solution.

His remarks come after Republicans met with Trump for [extensive budget talks](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5131668-house-republicans-trump-legislative-agenda/) on Thursday. The deadline to avert a government shutdown is March 14.

The press conference is scheduled to begin at 11:45 a.m. EST.

A new cover of Time magazine features billionaire Elon Musk behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office at the White House.

The photo illustration teased [a cover story](https://time.com/7213409/elon-musk-us-government-trump/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial&utm_term=politics_trump-administration&linkId=740835038) titled “Inside Elon Musk’s War on Washington,” and chronicled his [efforts](https://thehill.com/business/5130169-elon-musk-access-federal-payments-doge-treasury/) to [implement](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5131567-democrats-target-musk/) massive government reforms during President Trump’s first weeks in office.

Musk, the new head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has sparked widespread condemnation from Democrats and federal workers for his efforts to slash federal spending through job cuts, buyouts and other cost-saving measures.

The tech and media mogul has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, calling it full of “radical-left Marxists” and putting thousands of employees on administrative leave.

One of the richest people on earth, Musk was one of Trump’s most vocal supporters and biggest donors on the campaign trail and has vowed to work with the president to achieve his agenda.

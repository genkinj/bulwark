The U.S. economy added 143,000 jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent in January, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department.

The January jobs report, which covered the final month of former President Biden’s term, was largely in line with expectations. Economists expected the U.S. to have added roughly 170,000 jobs and maintain a jobless rate of 4.1 percent, according to consensus estimates.

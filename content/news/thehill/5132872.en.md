Former Vice President Harris on Friday pushed aside questions about a potential gubernatorial bid in California, saying she’d barely been home and wanted to connect with her local community.

“I have been home for two weeks and three days. My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them,” she told reporters on Friday after touring areas impacted by the Palisades wildfire.

“I am here and would be here regardless of the office I hold, because it is the right thing to do, which is to show up in your community and thank the folks who are on the ground,” she added.

In her comments, she highlighted the need for a stronger focus on evolving weather patterns and their impact on the state’s residents.

“These extreme weather conditions have become far more frequent than we have historically been used to and highlight the importance of not only a very meaningful and robust federal, state and local partnership among agencies and individuals, but really also highlight the fact that here in California, for example, we no longer talk about wildfire season,” she said.

“Any month of the year, we are likely to see these wildfires occur.”

A group of senators have proposed a new [Wildfire Intelligence Agency](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5130771-senate-legislation-new-wildfire-response-agency/) to help the federal response to natural disasters.

DeepSeek’s generative AI program acquires the data of U.S. users and stores the information for unidentified use by the CCP.”    The lawmakers pointed to a security research study published on Wednesday that found DeepSeek’s website contains computer code with the potential to send user login information to **China Mobile**.    The Chinese state-owned telecommunications company is prohibited from operating in the United States. The study was reported by [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/deepseek-china-generative-ai-internet-security-concerns-c52562f8c4760a81c4f76bc5fbdebad0?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB) on Wednesday.    DeepSeek is based in China, where companies are required to hand over data if requested by the government, further stoking fears over privacy and national security.    The one-year-old startup launched an **AI model called R1** last month, which quickly drew comparisons to models offered by OpenAI or Google. The app surged to the top of Apple’s App Store shortly after its release and sent U.S. stocks plunging.    *Read more in a full report at [TheHill.com](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5131103-deepseek-ban-government-devices/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB).* | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | Welcome to The Hill’s **Technology newsletter**, we’re Julia Shapero and Miranda Nazzaro — tracking the latest moves from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. | | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | **Did someone forward you this newsletter?

Progressive consumer rights group **Public Citizen** is calling on the Office of Government Ethics to open an investigation into whether Trump is violating a federal law barring presidents from solicitng gifts with the token.    The president launched **$TRUMP** just days before his inauguration. It’s considered a meme coin — a cryptocurrency based on an internet trend with no inherent value and prone to high levels of volatility.    Public Citizen pointed to social media posts promoting the token that Trump reshared on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, after he took office.    “[I]t appears Trump is not soliciting money in exchange for an investment or tangible product (such as a Bible, sports shoes, or a guitar), but soliciting money in exchange for nothing—that is, asking for a gift that will benefit him personally,” Public Citizen wrote in its complaint.    ***ICYMI:***Many in the crypto world [watched with concern](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5098607-trump-faces-crypto-world-backlash-after-launch-of-meme-coin/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB) last month as both Trump and his wife **Melania Trump** launched meme coins, voicing worries that the tokens could cast a negative light on the president’s efforts to boost crypto.    Trump has embraced the industry in his first weeks in office, naming **David Sacks** as artificial intelligence and crytpo czar and tasking him with developing a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **The Refresh** | | --- |  | *News we’ve flagged from**t**he intersection of tech and other topics:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | * OpenAI expected to make Super Bowl ad debut ([Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-set-to-make-super-bowl-ad-debut-8fa1aff5?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB)) * Workday plans to lay off about 1,750 employees as it focuses on investing in AI ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/02/06/workday-layoffs-ai/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB)) | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | |  | | --- | | | --- | --- |  | | | **In Other News** | | --- |  | *Branch out with other reads on The Hill:* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- |  | | | [I'm an image](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5130441-chris-coons-department-of-government-efficiency/?email=467cb6399cb7df64551775e431052b43a775c749&emaila=12a6d4d069cd56cfddaa391c24eb7042&emailb=054528e7403871c79f668e49dd3c44b1ec00c7f611bf9388f76bb2324d6ca5f3&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=02.06.25%20Tech%20JB) | | --- |  | **Senate Democrat: DOGE has ‘burrowed into the private information of every American’** | | --- |  | Sen.

Tom Homan, President Trump’s “[border czar](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/4984740-trump-border-czar-tom-homan-immigration-ice-deportation/),” is seething after an immigration raid in a suburb of Denver was [allegedly leaked](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-us-border-czar-blames-leaks-for-hindering-immigration-raids-in-colorado-suburb-spotlighted-by-trump/), allowing targets in the Venezuela-linked Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang to escape.

“This isn’t a game. We know that TDA is dangerous,” Homan said Thursday in a statement to reporters outside the White House.

“Everybody can agree to that, but when they get a heads-up that we are coming, it’s only a matter of time before our officers are ambushed,” he added, according to [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-aurora-ice-homan-9288225fe4eb3110651751f4743dafe0), “Their job is dangerous enough. So we are going to address this very seriously.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were still able to [carry out some arrests,](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5108322-dea-arrests-venezuela-gang-colorado/) but the number of individuals detained remains unclear. The agency has been actively documenting their deportation efforts via social media.

“100+ members of the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were targeted for arrest and detention in Aurora, Colo., today by ICE and its partners [@FBI](https://x.com/FBI) [@DEAHQ](https://x.com/DEAHQ) [@CBP](https://x.com/CBP) [@ATFHQ](https://x.com/ATFHQ) & [@USMarshalsHQ](https://x.com/USMarshalsHQ) in an ongoing investigation,” the agency wrote Wednesday in statement on [social platform X](https://x.com/ICEgov/status/1887170936819925317).

Agents raided an apartment complex frequented by gang members where several individuals died due to alleged fentanyl overdoses, AP reported. A local judge has identified the site as a public safety threat and ordered its closure by Feb. 18.

ICE averaged 787 [arrests](https://thehill.com/homenews/5108281-ice-arrests-956-sunday-as-nationwide-raids-continue/) a day from Jan. 23 to Jan. 31.

The arrests come after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [authorized the agency](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5099794-ice-arrests-schools-churches/) to carry out arrests in schools and churches late last month, rescinding a previous guideline that barred arrests in these “sensitive” areas. Denver Mayor Mike Johnston (D) [argued that the move](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5112126-denver-mayor-decries-immigration-raids-hospitals-schools/) infringed on the city’s public safety.

“It’s all for the good of this nation, and we’re going to keep going. No apologies,” Homan [told Fox News](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5109713-tom-homan-responds-immigration-raids-no-apologies/) in an interview last month, responding to Johnston’s complaints. “We’re moving forward.”

The two men have been at odds since the administration began acting on Trump’s pledge to [executive mass deportations](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5109536-trump-deportation-raids-criticisms/). The [border czar](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5060681-donald-trump-tom-homan-border-czar-migrants/) even [threatened to put the mayor in jail](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5009692-tom-homan-denver-mayor-marty-johnston-deportation-plans/) if he refuses to cooperate with the president’s [immigration orders](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/5105543-trumps-immigration-crackdown-southern-border-birthright-citizenship-aslyum-refugee-programs-biden/).

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for additional comment.

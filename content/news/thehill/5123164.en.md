(NEXSTAR) — Millions are expected to tune in to Super Bowl LIX on Sunday. While some are tuning in for the game or the ads, you may have a different focus: Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show.

The Grammy-winning rapper [announced he had landed the coveted gig in September](https://www.ktsm.com/news/rapper-kendrick-lamar-to-headline-super-bowl-lix-halftime-show), telling viewers he hoped they would “be pulling up” for the performance and encouraging them to “wear your best dress,” even if they’re tuning in from home.

This isn’t Kendrick Lamar’s first Super Bowl performance. He was among the group of artists who [headlined the halftime show during Super Bowl LVI](https://fox8.com/sports/heres-whos-playing-this-years-super-bowl-halftime-show/#:~:text=Sunday%2C%20they're%20getting%20five,SoFi%20Stadium%20in%20Inglewood%2C%20California.&text=Bringing%20a%20legendary%20group%20of,Dre.) in 2022, sharing the spotlight with hip-hop legends Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, and Dr. Dre.

The rap megastar — who, earlier this month, secured the Grammy award for song of the year with his diss track, “Not Like Us” — said he’s looking forward to bringing hip-hop to the NFL’s championship game.

“Rap music is still the most impactful genre to date,” Lamar said in a September statement. “And I’ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.”

Like other halftime performers before him, Lamar has shared little about what is in store for us on Feb. 9. Here are a few things we do know.

### When will Kendrick Lamar’s halftime show start?

Saying the show will start halfway through the game probably isn’t helpful. But, we can use a bit of math to give you a window of when to tune in to see Kendrick Lamar and at least one guest.

An NFL game is split into four 15-minute quarters, two before halftime and two after. The play clock will stop and start countless times, and play will be interrupted by flags, commercial breaks, and timeouts. However, the average NFL game lasts about three hours.

With kickoff set for 6:30 p.m. ET, that would put the start of the halftime show likely between 8 and 8:30 p.m. ET.

### Kendrick Lamar won’t be taking the field alone

A fellow Grammy winner, [SZA, will join Lamar during the halftime performance](https://wgntv.com/news/trending/sza-to-join-kendrick-lamar-for-super-bowl-lix-halftime-show/). They share multiple hits, including “All the Stars” and “Doves in the Wind.” SZA also appeared on Lamar’s latest album, “GNX,” in songs “luther” and “gloria.” Lamar, in turn, accompanied SZA on “30 For 30” for her 2024 album, “SOS Deluxe: LANA.” (The pair is [also going on tour](https://wgntv.com/news/deans-list/kendrick-lamar-sza-playing-soldier-field-next-summer-in-national-tour/) this year.)

There has, of course, been [speculation that another Grammy winner could join Lamar](https://wgntv.com/sports/the-big-game/fans-wonder-if-taylor-swift-will-perform-with-kendrick-lamar-at-super-bowl-lix/) during the halftime performance: Taylor Swift. Swift and Lamar have worked together before — the latter appeared on a remix of “Bad Blood” in 2015. Lamar even rerecorded his verse for the song when Swift released the “Taylor’s Version” of her “1989” album.

While she is expected to be in attendance to support her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, it’s unlikely that she’ll take the field herself. Even [prop bet markets are leaning against it](https://wgntv.com/sports/the-big-game/fans-wonder-if-taylor-swift-will-perform-with-kendrick-lamar-at-super-bowl-lix/).

### Odds say he’ll perform his Grammy-winning diss track — despite lawsuit

“Not Like Us” might have given Lamar the win in a beef he had with fellow rapper Drake last year, but there’s been some uncertainty surrounding whether he’ll perform the track during the Super Bowl.

The song — which gave Lamar Grammy Awards for song and record of the year — has remained popular. As of Feb. 3, it ranked as No. 29 on the [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/), up from No. 33 in the previous week. It has been on the list for 37 weeks.

Drake has, however, [filed lawsuits over the track](https://wgntv.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/celebrities-who-had-the-worst-year-in-2024/). In January, he sued Universal Music Group — the parent record label for both artists — for defamation, claiming the label published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. In November, Drake [sued UMG and Spotify](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5010463-drake-spotify-universal-music-kendrick-lamar-not-like-us/), accusing both of inflating the streaming numbers for “Not Like US,” a claim UMG denied.

Still, [oddsmakers say](https://www.covers.com/nfl/super-bowl/props/halftime-bets) it’s likely Lamar will perform what is arguably his biggest song. Even Fox, which is airing the Super Bowl this year, [used an instrumental version](https://frontofficesports.com/kendrick-lamar-drake-halftime-not-like-us/) of “Not Like Us” to tease Lamar’s performance during the NFC Championship last month.

### What other songs could Kendrick Lamar perform?

Kendrick Lamar hasn’t shared anything about his setlist, though it seems likely he’ll perform “Not Like Us” and at least one of the tracks he shares with SZA.

Oddsmakers are also pointing at his 2017 hit “Humble” as a likely Super Bowl Halftime track, followed by “King Kunta,” “Squabble Up,” “DNA,” and “A.D.H.D.”

He may, however, avoid the songs he performed during the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show: “M.A.A.D. City” and “Alright.”

[How does the NFL pick its Super Bowl cities?](https://wgntv.com/sports/the-big-game/how-does-the-nfl-pick-its-super-bowl-cities/?ipid=promo-link-block3) 

Lamar and SZA have only about 15 minutes (typically, medleys of songs are performed during halftime shows, not the full track), giving them time to feature about a dozen songs.

Last year, Usher — joined by Alicia Keys, Jermaine Dupri, H.E.R., will.i.am, Lil Jon, Ludacris, and a marching band — had 12 songs on his Super Bowl LVIII Halftime Show setlist. [Rihanna](https://www.newsnationnow.com/entertainment-news/2023-super-bowl-half-time-show-3-things-to-know/) performed the same number of tracks the previous year. In 2022, Lamar and his fellow rap legends had nine songs on their setlist.

While it’s too soon to say what songs we’ll see during the Super Bowl halftime show this year, we can tell you the game is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Sunday, Feb. 9.

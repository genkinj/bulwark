President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba are set to give remarks to the press after their [White House meeting](https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-japans-leader-says-hes-preparing-for-tough-negotiations-with-trump-on-maintaining-us-presence/) on Friday.

Ishiba, under the shadow of a minority government, is looking to bolster the relationship between the U.S. and Japan and negotiate with Trump to keep a presence in the island nation amid threats from China and North Korea. The White House, [according to The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/world/asia/japan-ishiba-trump-summit.html), will likely push for Tokyo to purchase more U.S.-made weapons or energy, as well as taking on more of the defense burden in the Asia-Pacific region.

Trump named [George Edward Glass](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5043468-trump-names-pick-for-ambassador-to-japan/) to serve as the ambassador to Japan. Glass was an ambassador to Portugal during the president’s first administration.

The meeting also follows the president’s [vow in December to block](https://thehill.com/business/5019060-trump-opposes-nippon-steel-acquisition/) a Japanese company from acquiring U.S. Steel.

The press conference is scheduled to begin at 1:10 p.m. EST.

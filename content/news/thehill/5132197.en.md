Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are set to speak Friday morning, following a closed-door meeting.

They were originally scheduled to meet on Thursday, but [budget talks](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5131668-house-republicans-trump-legislative-agenda/) with President Trump forced the two to postpone the meeting.

Their press conference comes just days after Trump [floated a proposal](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127021-trump-us-takeover-gaza/) for the U.S. to [take control of Gaza](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5129814-donald-trump-gaza-strip-us-troops/). Netanyahu and Johnson have both [signaled support](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5128238-mike-johnson-trump-gaza-takeover/) for [the idea](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5130196-trump-gaza-us-takeover/), despite [mounting scrutiny](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127616-gaza-donald-trump-democrats-ethnic-cleansing/) from others, including lawmakers, [U.S. allies and adversaries](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127510-donald-trump-gaza-takeover-allies-adversaries-react/).

Netanyahu visited the White House on Tuesday and held a [joint press conference](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5127164-trump-netanyahu-joint-presser/) with the president. Congress [later put a hold](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5126369-congress-israel-arms-sale-hold/) on the administrationâ€™s plans to announce a $1 billion arms sale package for Israel.

Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, recently reached [a ceasefire agreement](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5092533-trump-israel-gaza-ceasefire/) that put a pause on more than 15 months of fighting.

Johnson and Netanyahu are expected to begin speaking at 10:25 a.m. EST.

President Trump shared excitement for the [approaching Super Bowl](https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/5126859-nfl-to-scrap-end-racism-messaging-on-field-for-super-bowl/) which he lauded as a “great” event in spite of the National Football League’s (NFL) [new kickoff rule](https://thehill.com/homenews/4944639-trump-criticizes-new-nfl-kickoff-rule/) which he deemed “weird.”

“Two great Quarterbacks in this game. Also, an unbelievable running back, and the absolute best tight end in football (Ever!). Incredible coaching,” the president wrote in a Friday [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113962763765213252) post.

“If they would only get rid of that really weird looking new Kickoff ‘deal,’ which actually makes football more dangerous, they would be doing everybody, especially the fans, a big favor,” he added.

The NFL imposed a new rule aimed at decreasing injuries by moving kickoffs to the 35-yard line, while the receiving team starts out more condensed to limit high-speed collisions.

The president is expected to [attend](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5125557-donald-trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-2025/) the highly anticipated game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs for Super Bowl LIX.  The game, which is set for 6:30 p.m. EST, will take place at Caesars Superdome between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. The Chiefs are aiming for their third straight Super Bowl win.

Trump is also expected to sit for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, which will air ahead of the Super Bowl on Sunday.

“ANYWAY, IT WILL BE A GREAT GAME!!! I’ll be doing the interview, before the game, at 3:00 P.M. There hasn’t been one in four years (Gee, I wonder why?),” he wrote in a statement.

It is also a tradition for the president to invite the Super Bowl champions to the White House. Trump [disinvited the Eagles](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390667-trump-disinvites-eagles-from-white-house-visit-plans-different-type/) after their 2018 win, after learning that nearly all the players had plans to boycott the visit.

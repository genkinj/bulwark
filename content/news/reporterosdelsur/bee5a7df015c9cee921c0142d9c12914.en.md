Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service is currently in a bit of a bind—new subscriptions are off the table! As gamers eagerly await the chance to join or rejoin this popular cloud gaming platform, Nvidia is hitting pause on most plans due to a major shift in its payment processing system.

In the next couple of weeks, day passes will make a triumphant return, bringing a glimmer of hope for those wanting a quick gaming fix. However, the full subscription plans that cater to avid gamers will remain unavailable for a while longer. Nvidia aims to transition payment processing in-house, a move that could take at least five weeks, leaving many feeling frustrated.

Luckily, existing subscribers have something to cheer about! During this transition, they won’t be billed, keeping their accounts in good standing without cost. This gesture gives a nod to Nvidia’s commitment to its users, ensuring that loyal customers remain happy during this downtime.

While the delays may leave potential new gamers in limbo, Nvidia appears to be preparing for smoother sailing ahead. The hope is that this upgrade will ultimately enhance the gaming experience on GeForce Now.

As the gaming world watches closely, those looking to dive into cloud gaming may want to mark their calendars for a possible resurgence of full subscriptions down the line. For now, patience is key, but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Keep your eyes peeled for updates, and get ready to jump into the cloud gaming revolution!

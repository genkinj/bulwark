Generative AI burst onto the scene with the launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, transforming not only technology but also the domains of high-performance computing (HPC) and technical innovation. This surge has raised critical questions within the HPC community: **How can we harness AI to enhance our scientific discoveries?** As the demand for larger and more capable AI models continues to strain resources, the future of AI in research hangs in the balance.

The quest for efficiency and accuracy isn’t without its pitfalls. Reports of AI “hallucinations” have left researchers bemused as even basic scientific inquiries can yield alarming inaccuracies. Imagine asking if water freezes at 27°F and receiving a comically incorrect response! To truly support science and technology, AI must evolve and eliminate these errors.

One solution may lie in leveraging the vast amounts of unique data generated by HPC. Unlike traditional AI datasets, scientific data can be clean, tunable, and experimental, offering a perfect backbone for AI training. Think of Microsoft’s Aurora model, which achieved a stunning 5,000-fold increase in meteorological forecasting speed thanks to diverse data inputs.

As we venture into the realm of Large Quantitative Models (LQMs) designed to predict numerical outcomes rather than words, the collaboration between scientists and data analysts is vital. Companies like SandboxAQ are already pioneering this approach, focusing their efforts on health, energy, and more.

In essence, the key takeaway here is clear: **By embracing the synergy of Generative AI and HPC, we can unlock unprecedented advancements in science.** The journey is underway, and the future holds remarkable potential!

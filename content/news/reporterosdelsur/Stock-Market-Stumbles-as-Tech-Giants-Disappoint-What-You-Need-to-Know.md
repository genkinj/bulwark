As the sun sets on Wall Street, US stock futures are dipping, reflecting a wave of anxiety following disappointing forecasts from tech heavyweights like Amazon and Google. With the Dow Jones hovering around stability and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each sliding by 0.1%, investors are feeling the pinch.

The current earnings season has been marked by fervent discussions about artificial intelligence (AI). After a significant stir from DeepSeek’s innovative breakthroughs, concerns have mounted regarding the astronomical costs of AI development, especially at Meta and Microsoft. Amazon’s recent earnings report further fueled this narrative, triggering a sharp 4% drop in its stock after hours—a trend echoed by Google and AMD earlier this week.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom. While some tech giants falter, others are seizing the AI wave. Palantir’s military analytics unit surged by an impressive 10%, and Pinterest enjoyed an astounding 19% spike in trading, thanks to its AI-enhanced ad sales strategy.

Adding to the turmoil, President Trump’s mixed messages on tariffs have traders scrambling, prompting a flight to safety, with gold reaching new highs. Meanwhile, Trump is eyeing hedge funds, vowing to close tax loopholes that favor fund managers.

Looking ahead, all eyes will be on the upcoming January jobs report, as economists predict a slowdown in hiring but maintain optimism about the labor market’s resilience. The ongoing narrative unfolds—what will be the ultimate takeaway for investors navigating this turbulent landscape?
